            "We were arranged in the AC-room which was nice, just a little crowded and noisy due to the peak dinner time. The staffs were super friendly and treated us really well. The food was authentic Thai quality so it was worth trying! Highly recommend!",
            "Great service great food and their iced coffee is the best Ive had. Must try their slow cooked pork.",
            "The food is very mediocre - the price is high and not worth it. We wanted to skip the queue in One Chun and came here but regretted.",
            "We have to wait 15 mins at the peak hour at 1PM. The atmosphere is nice. The food is incredible. Highly recommend the crab curry and pork stew in the first page of the menu. We also order the deep fried pork and sticky rice with mango, both are good but not as excellent as the crab curry and pork stew. Beware that the potion here is quite big. We are 2 adult males but cannot finish our meal and have to take away the deep fried pork.",
            "Resident in Thailand for 12 years, I love Thai cuisine and I know it very well. I can tell you that this restaurant is a sham: 3 dishes out of 6 were literally inedible, believe me! How can you serve reps like that without checking. In addition: the walls of the restaurants are very dirty, filled with fly or lizard poo... Who can still think that this restaurant is still an institution in Phuket except for a passing tourist who will get ripped off.",
            "Very good traditional Thai food in an old Sino-Portuguese style house. Some nice seating outdoors if the weather is good. All of the dishes were very good. Service was professional and polite.",
            "We've visited Raya twice as the food was so good. We had the crab yellow curry, prawns (both tamarind and chilli,salt ), spingrolls and it was all delicious. Quick service too. Reasonably priced and friendly staff.",
            "We had a fun time at the night market nearby. Managed to get a table and felt really welcomed by the local crew. Cute retro decor. Nice menu thats not common dishes that you would see in your usual Thai restaurant. We had a wonderful crab meat curry with local rice noodles, fish balls and loca beans with prawns. They offered 2 sizes of the dishes which is usual when you want to try more dishes. They also offered complimentary mango after your meal. Will definitely come back.",
            "A heritage restaurant set in a very old but restored and perfect building. Authentic and traditional Thai cuisine and timely and efficient service. This is a Michelin star restaurant for 3 years, yet very moderately priced. The Manager and his team do a fantastic job to assist you with your order and ensure you dont over order. A must visit place to enjoy that food in Phuket.",
            "It tastes like Bangkok-born chef, where most curries are less spicey than Southern food restaurant in Bangkok. Pork omelet is rare stuff and tasty but its not southern dish at all. There are plenty of southern taste around with half a price if you try.",
            "Very good foods with good quality. Tasty. The premise is renovated old style house. Very fancy. I recommend crab meat curry with thin noodles, Fried-pan Liang leaves with egg and shrimps. A little spicy though.",
            "First time to visit this restaurant. The foods have many choices, almost starting from 200 baht, taste were normal. Good location, all staff are friendly.",
            "This is a popular restaurant in old Phuket town, that's been around for a long time. The reputation it has carries a lot of weight and brings in a lot of customers. We ordered some of their signature dishes like Moo Hong, Kuakling, and Gai Kamin, and all of them were quite good. Portions are suitable for two people sharing. The atmosphere was that of a local restaurant that serves people it knows. It doesn't seem to need or want to appeal to tourists. So it has an authentic Sino-Thai feel to it. There is a small room with air conditioning, off the the right of the main room. Otherwise the restaurant is cooled by ceiling fans.",
            "Best Thai cuisine we had in Phuket, the shrimps ceviche with garlic, chilli and serve with chilli dipping sauce is a must try. The 2 stories building is lovely, no air conditioning but the temperature is much lower than outside.",
            "Had the fried rice with crab, generous amounts of crab & spicy minced pork with basil. Service was good and a bit off the road so no exhaust fumes."
