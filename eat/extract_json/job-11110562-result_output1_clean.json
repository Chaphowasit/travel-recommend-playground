            "We were arranged in the AC-room which was nice, just a little crowded and noisy due to the peak dinner time. The staffs were super friendly and treated us really well. The food was authentic Thai quality so it was worth trying! Highly recommend!",
            "Great service great food and their iced coffee is the best Ive had. Must try their slow cooked pork.",
            "The food is very mediocre - the price is high and not worth it. We wanted to skip the queue in One Chun and came here but regretted.",
            "We have to wait 15 mins at the peak hour at 1PM. The atmosphere is nice. The food is incredible. Highly recommend the crab curry and pork stew in the first page of the menu. We also order the deep fried pork and sticky rice with mango, both are good but not as excellent as the crab curry and pork stew. Beware that the potion here is quite big. We are 2 adult males but cannot finish our meal and have to take away the deep fried pork.",
            "Resident in Thailand for 12 years, I love Thai cuisine and I know it very well. I can tell you that this restaurant is a sham: 3 dishes out of 6 were literally inedible, believe me! How can you serve reps like that without checking. In addition: the walls of the restaurants are very dirty, filled with fly or lizard poo... Who can still think that this restaurant is still an institution in Phuket except for a passing tourist who will get ripped off.",
            "Very good traditional Thai food in an old Sino-Portuguese style house. Some nice seating outdoors if the weather is good. All of the dishes were very good. Service was professional and polite.",
            "We've visited Raya twice as the food was so good. We had the crab yellow curry, prawns (both tamarind and chilli,salt ), spingrolls and it was all delicious. Quick service too. Reasonably priced and friendly staff.",
            "We had a fun time at the night market nearby. Managed to get a table and felt really welcomed by the local crew. Cute retro decor. Nice menu thats not common dishes that you would see in your usual Thai restaurant. We had a wonderful crab meat curry with local rice noodles, fish balls and loca beans with prawns. They offered 2 sizes of the dishes which is usual when you want to try more dishes. They also offered complimentary mango after your meal. Will definitely come back.",
            "A heritage restaurant set in a very old but restored and perfect building. Authentic and traditional Thai cuisine and timely and efficient service. This is a Michelin star restaurant for 3 years, yet very moderately priced. The Manager and his team do a fantastic job to assist you with your order and ensure you dont over order. A must visit place to enjoy that food in Phuket.",
            "It tastes like Bangkok-born chef, where most curries are less spicey than Southern food restaurant in Bangkok. Pork omelet is rare stuff and tasty but its not southern dish at all. There are plenty of southern taste around with half a price if you try.",
            "Very good foods with good quality. Tasty. The premise is renovated old style house. Very fancy. I recommend crab meat curry with thin noodles, Fried-pan Liang leaves with egg and shrimps. A little spicy though.",
            "First time to visit this restaurant. The foods have many choices, almost starting from 200 baht, taste were normal. Good location, all staff are friendly.",
            "This is a popular restaurant in old Phuket town, that's been around for a long time. The reputation it has carries a lot of weight and brings in a lot of customers. We ordered some of their signature dishes like Moo Hong, Kuakling, and Gai Kamin, and all of them were quite good. Portions are suitable for two people sharing. The atmosphere was that of a local restaurant that serves people it knows. It doesn't seem to need or want to appeal to tourists. So it has an authentic Sino-Thai feel to it. There is a small room with air conditioning, off the the right of the main room. Otherwise the restaurant is cooled by ceiling fans.",
            "Best Thai cuisine we had in Phuket, the shrimps ceviche with garlic, chilli and serve with chilli dipping sauce is a must try. The 2 stories building is lovely, no air conditioning but the temperature is much lower than outside.",
            "Had the fried rice with crab, generous amounts of crab & spicy minced pork with basil. Service was good and a bit off the road so no exhaust fumes."

            "I already stayed 10 days in Thailand before I learned about this place and I feel so disappointed that on the last day Im staying in Kata I eat really well. Its the first and only place by far that served authentic Thai food. I... ordered som tum, fried rice with chicken, kana moo krob and tasted the laab who was really fresh of taste and aloy aloy aloy !!! Ofcourse the children ordered pizza and this by surprise was pleasant eating. They had the chicken wings. The som tum was a little underflavoured but I guess thats on my behalf because I asked them to not make it that spicy so my son could also eat it. I just missed like herbs on the table to adjust it yourself a little . The staff is really friendly. Pricerange is so appealing and Im so happy that we eat so many different things. Thanks for letting us eat good food, even if it was on our last day here in Kata, I hope that our next destination will have the same kind of restaurant, where you can enjoy good food and sit inside a nice temperature and not to be bothered from mosquitoes and flies.

            "Having lived in Phuket for more than 15 years we discovered Sam's during COVIDs and in the period of COVID and before moving to Buriram, earlier this year, we became regulars at Sams enjoying the food and hospitality of the staff. Having returned on a business trip this week to Phuket we only stayed at the Holiday so we could enjoy Sam's. We were not disappointed. The food as always was excellent the staff were friendly and hospitable as if we had never been away. Sams is certainly our favourite restaurant in Phuket if not Thailand, and well justified our stay at the Holiday Inn. In my opinion, Sams would be at home in London, Paris or Sydney everything works well with the style the restaurant, staff and the food all complimenting each other which is a credit to Khun Supachais management and team members such as Khun Aom.",

The senior waiter I presume approached to take the plates away & asked if all was ok when I pointed out to him the smell he opened the bun took a smell & agreed it was not right ,at no time were we offered anything to make good so we promptly paid in full & now will never visit a HRC again sorry this has literally left a bad taste .",

            "We 6 friends went to this cafe. We asked price of liquor bottle and it was 1.5 times then normal. Then we decided to buy same liquor bottle from nearby 7/11 store and pay drinking charges around 300 TBH at cafe. Care taker was not happy at all as we bought it from outside. We ordered food from there and at the time of billing we were charged with service charge and VAT on final bill around 450 TBH. This were not at all normal charges as per our experience in patong with other restaurants. Caretaker fooled us saying VAT is refundable at airport, FYI food items do not get VAT refund and only physical items with invoice gets VAT refund. So be aware when you visit this restaurant, they charge you extra for no reasons.",
            "It was a terrible experience, you are being watched by staff constantly and even when they come to you they dont understand, I would not go back If they offered free food for 1 week for me , tasteless food, fair enough lots of good reviews but compared to other Indian restaurants this is the worst so far.",
            "Pathetic experience- the place has an absolute atrocious food. Name is madras cafe and has a horrible South Indian food. Absolutely avoidable.",
            "Very average food. Both south indian and northIndian food was tasteless. There are many other options for Indian food in Phuket. This one can definitely be skipped.",

            "Just had the best butter chicken and garlic naan I've had in a very long time! food and service was just top great. Plus the place is open till 2 am.",
            "Worst Food ever eaten. They don't know to cook Indian vegetarian food. I am sure the one who wrote positive earlier, either they are unaware of the right Indian food. Even the head staff who was present that time is most wierd and his answers too. Anyways they didn't disclose who is the actual head there. I ordered chilli Paneer dosa and they first gave me Dosa with just red chilli powder inside. After notifying they made again but again unfortunately they made with putting red chilli powder and few countable scrumbbled paneer pieces. I think either the chef should go and learn how is Chilli Paneer Dosa with even ordinary chef in India as they changed the whole meaning of the dish. On complaining again that in photo it is shown different and the wierdest answer I received from the head was 'photo is photo' and instead of being guilty he was laughing that this is the way they cook. I really feel sad that people end up going thinking it is good restuarant but I will request my friends to manage with any other cuisine but not eating at this plae. Even I am sure the kitchen will be most unhygenic, for which I will complain to the food authority in Phuket definitely. The other dishes what we ordered was also poor quality. Sadly, even their fried rice was poor quality which I think is the most easiest thing in Indian Food. I won't recommend anyone this restuarant. Infact, I would request Trip Advisor to drop his ratings so many people don't become the culprit. This is first ever rating I put for some restuarant on Trip Advisor because it was really worst. Now in Bangkok is 3.50 am that is midnight and I ended vomitting badly because of the poor quality of food. Not recommended for Indian Vegetarians.",

            "We had a mix tandoori platter and none of the food items on the platter was fresh. Whats worse, the food arrived cold when it supposedly to have been cooked in the tandoor oven! We were the only customers at the time. Also, when the time came for us to pay, we were told that they no longer accept credit card payments, which was appalling considering the substantial bill.

Service is quick, food is fresh and reasonably priced. Its located on main street of patong which is a bonus. Do try this restaurant if you are looking for a good Indian vegetarian meal.",

            "Positives 1. South India food - dosa and idli were excellent 2. Good service Negatives 1. Poor ambience 2. We had specifically asked before ordering Samosas if they were authentic and were assured that to be the case. However the potatoes turned out to be boiled and flavorless. When we asked them why that was the case they said that it was to cater to an Arabic clientele who likes bland food, something we doubt. 3. DO NOT order kulfi. Overpriced, frozen like a rock and does not look like what is shown in the pictures.",
            "We are on leisure trip to Phuket and visited Patong beach with family. After a few days of local food, we wanted to have Indian food. In a shopping mall you will find directions and even agents to direct to this cafe. The ambience of the cafe is seemingly very old . Even though the dosas we odered were tasty as in India but the crockery was very primitive. The plastic bowl in which sambhar was served was cracked. When we were checking out, I wanted to give my feedback. One incoming young lady volunteered that I can give my feedback to her, even though she was not visible there for our lunch time. Anyways I conveyed my concerns and that we didnt like that food was served in broken crockery.",
            "Easy to identfy from Bangala St Alhocol served BOth AC and non AC places available Little bit costly Interior not good",
            "Very low quality Dosa , sambar and chutney Had terrible acidity and upset stomach Better try Hare Krishna restaurant which is about half km walking distance say 15 minutes walk...see Google maps",
            "Had the chicken dosa. That was very very nice. Ordered a chicken kabab and a lamb kabab platter too. Enjoyed the lamb kabab but the chicken kabab was very average. Very friendly staff.",
            "Seeking a break from Thai food I came across this place. Enjoyed the South Indian vegetarian thali. It was great quality - authentic flavours.",
            "I feel the positive reviews are from friends but what do I know. The fish was undercooked and full of bones, the chicken dish tasted ok but was barely warm, the rice was cold too and the portions were small. The beer was warm, even asking for a glass with ice, it melted quick and the beer was still warm. The prices were way too high. The single toilet was disgusting. I just hope I'm OK tomorrow. All in all a bad experience, would definitely recommend to go elsewhere.",
            "Lovely get authentic South Indian food in place like thiland. Good taste , nice spread but slightly on expensive side However overall definitely worth visiting",
            "Long waiting period, the food was average, also after ordering food the management would test your patience and ask you to change your order, or replace it with some pricey item, in order to increase their bill amount. The place also didn't serve the complimentary onion salad which is served at every restaurant in Phuket.",
            "Great food with variety from Indian platter, must for Indians who yearn for own authentic food at Phuket. Nice n simple place .",
            "Worst experience No taste in any food Only paneer chilli was little palatable Never recommend to go there",
            "I am giving a 2 star due to service. We ordered and after all orders were taken the manager came to tell us that there was no lamb. After changing all our orders to chicken the manager came back and said the lamb was suddenly available. Yet again we had to change the order back. After sitting for nearly 2hrs we finally got our food and the waiter had no clue what food was what. The waiter asked us to taste our food to see if it was what we ordered. The food tasted good however the service is poor. Disappointing it could be better.",
            "Waited approximately 2 hours to have food served. Others around us ate and left, while we sat and waited. Only served food at 12am. Waiters didn't know any of the food names, had to taste test and guess who's was whos. Truly disappointed. WiFi is slow as well.",
            "Excellent food ,very friendly owner ,Jain food was tasty ,Indian taste friendly staff ,good ambience",

We reserved a patio table to enjoy the al fresco setting while watching the sweeping views of Mai Khao beach & the Andaman sea. Khun Rainbow made sure we were looked after through out our meal and stay. The interior features high wooden ceilings built from teak wood. Our food was presented beautifully and each dish was delicious. Our desert was Itim Khao Niaow Tub Tim along with Pad Thai. We came back a couple of days later to make another booking and we were greeted by our first names - very impressive. All staff who were dressed in contemporary style Thai uniforms were gracious and attentive. We will return Watch out for the elephants passing Good luck to Rinny for her future endeavours",

However the service was excellent and the food superb. Loved the hot Camembert with delicious bread. My salmon was excellent perfectly cooked. We are back again next week hopefully a bit busier",
            "I booked the SSC for my husband's birthday several months in advance. A decision I came to regret. The fact that it was empty on a Friday evening when other establishments were very busy was a sign of what was to come. The service was incredibly poor. Trying to get a drink was difficult- I had to go to the bar to reorder the drinks twice before we received them. The food we ordered was on par with a fast food outlet, which we barley touched. We decided to cut our visit short. Unfortunately, I later discovered that I had been charged for service and VAT despite the menu and drinks list stating that they were included. Not an experience I would want to repeat.",
            "The Supper Club was for years my favourite restaurant in Cherngtalay. Glamorous excellent food and superlative service. How things have changed. The place is still lovely and thankfully little has changed there. The food and the service however have dropped dramatically. From a waitress that did not know the menu to a manager who knew nothing of the famous baba ghanoush that they used to serve. I had my favourite that was the lamb but not even close to the excellence it used to be!",
            "STILL GREAT PLACE LIKE YEARS BEFORE. My first visit in the SSC was around 8 years ago or so. The atmosphere is still coszy yet fancy and I still have the feeling of getting back in old NY Jazz times. Neo the restaurant manager did his best to provide a cozy dinner experience. He even managed to hold the table for as with a later arrival of 45 minutes because of lot of traffic. Thx Neo for that! Food was great and service good. Will come again for sure.",
            "It's disheartening when a dining experience falls short of expectations. The lack of welcoming and accommodating service from the manager and staff is definitely concerning and can greatly impact the overall impression of the establishment. Upon arrival, the unavailability of seating despite the presence of numerous empty tables inside, coupled with the staff's inability to provide a satisfactory explanation, is disappointing. It's especially regrettable that despite your group's willingness to spend generously, the staff did not prioritize your comfort and satisfaction. Hospitality and customer service are essential components of any dining experience, and it's unfortunate that this establishment failed to deliver in these aspects. I hope that the restaurant takes your feedback to heart and uses it as an opportunity to improve their customer service and overall experience. Thank you for sharing your experience, and I hope your future dining endeavors are much more pleasant.",

Honestky such tasty food and brilliant cocktails (margarita and lychee daiquiri) and a really delicious Pinot gris. The pistachio ice cream is also worth a try! Staff are absolutely lovely, will look forward to coming back",

            "So happy to see Supper Club getting back to where it was. The new Chef, Dave, is full on enthusiasm and very service oriented. The food we had was delicious and also great to have Khun Kay leading front of house so well. Front of house service focus has been missing for a while but on Friday everything was fabulous. Keep up the good work and look forward to Supper Club becoming our regular cocktail and dinner spot again!",
            "Came here for an evening out and was pleasantly surprised how lovely the place is. The staff were very attentive but not in an overbearing way. The decor is really nice with loads of great photos from the past. It has a good but not extensive menu, but will find something to eat for everybody. The food and service were perfect, and we had a thoroughly enjoyable evening.",
            "This was always one of my favorites on Phuket, but after missing a couple of years with Covid I wasnt sure what to expect. There is new management, a new chef, and a whole new vibe; and someone they have improved on what was already close to perfection. Cant wait to see what these guys do with the place in the future!!",
            "Been coming to SSC for over 15 years and regularly in the passed 12 years. Sadly, during Covid, it shut for sometime, opened on occasions, closed early, the old owner called it a day and sold up. We returned with friends in September and it was mediocre at best, the food and service being weak parts. We returned in December as a family and the service had slipped further. There doesn't seem to be any Maitre 'd anymore which is an issue for a place like this. No spare plate for rib bones, no finger bowl. Waitress takes your empty beer glass AND DOESN'T ASK if you would like another, just walks off.... Incredible. Food was so-so, not a talking point, the quality is not there. All this, the attention to detail, the training of staff, it's an easy fix. Food suppliers are 10 a penny here, give them a try. Dine at other restaurants and see the difference. Correct the issues quick enough and you'll have a good high season.",
            "Finally after 3 years, I was able to spend an evening again in that great restaurant, after being there many times before. And I have to say, its still absolutely classy, there is still brilliant food, the service is really great, so actually all was perfect even with great music. One thing, the restaurant is not really responsible for, are the guests. This time there were some annoying Russians beside my table. People who dont know to behave in such a lovely place. But finally they left and could not influence my opinion about this restauant: its simply great and a must visit!",
            "The restaurant has a nice interior, very tasteful design and they have live music [jazz] which is very pleasant and enhances the experience. Their menu has quite a limited choice and is quite expensive which would be fine if the quality of the food matched up with this. However the food is not high qulaity and is average therefore it is not really good value for money. The service is attebtive and very good but they need to improve their kitchen.",
            "The ravioli was good The mini burger was amazing The mussels were not bad The jazz was smooth The place so fancy so clean Best day of my life"

            "Our party of four enjoyed the ambience of this well located restaurant overlooking Patong and the beautiful, colourful and delicious food. The cost is similar to a good restaurant back in Australia. The wine prices though were very steep.",
            "We ordered 4 dishes n the crab meat with half cooked noodles was the best. The tom yum goong was v average, while the beef in green curry was tender, the curry was average too,as was the fried squid. The ambience of the restaurant was nice because of its location n the pianist added to it but because the place was not air conditioned it had to rely on stand fans which were not really doing the job. I was perspiring throughout the entire meal although I was not eating anything spicy or scalding hot!",
            "Appreciate your comments. Most people love the food, and we do our best to appeal to most tastes, which can be difficult. No air-conditioning is because our restaurant is open on all sides for the view. I do agree that it is hot at the moment. We are all suffering from the longest hot season in years. Unfortunately, that is beyond our control and we do the best we can with the ample number of fans, which at this time might be a little inadequate.",
            "Fantastic location, wonderful views & sunset. It was a special occasion and food & service was impeccable. Loved the satay skewers, vegetable spring rolls & pad see ew.",
            "Very pleased to know you loved Baan Rim Pa. Thank you for coming.",
            "Great way to end the day - our letter group was well created for after a late booking. Excellent food and great service. Location and setting added to the experience - best part ,- the flavours in the different course.",
            "We had dinner here during a family vacation . The restaurant and location are lovely. The service was excellent and they had real napkins- something unusual in Thailand. Our drinks were good and the food was good. This was the most upscale restaurant we ate in during our 2 weeks in Thailand - the price reflected that. For Thailand standards it is expensive. The food was good but not better than places we ate for much less money. Know that you are paying for the service and the view and a very pleasant experience .",
            "Beautiful restaurant, beautiful setting, fantastic service and incredible food. There is nothing not to like. The staff knew it was our 30th wedding anniversary and made it so special for us we cannot thank them enough We were even given a complimentary dessert souvenir photo and baseball caps- completely unexpected and so kind",
            "Your review has made our team very happy. We try and make everyone's dining experience special. But, when there is a major event, such as yours, we do try a little harder. Thank you for spending your special occasion with us at Baan Rim Pa.",
            "Great food and service. The view was absolutely breathtaking! Toilets are nice and clean. My family really enjoyed ourselves and I would come again.",
            "Thank you very much for your help about our reservation, I really appreciate it It was our first experience at your place and we loved it all : food, decoration, service, atmosphere, location. You made our evening amazing with the lovely suprise : picture taken & printed, delicious dessert, nice gift. Please accept my congratulations about your professionalism. Wishing you and your team a very successful year.",

            "What a gorgeous restaurant, and the views was remarkable despite the smoggy air. The food and service were impeccable.",
            "Thank you so much for visiting Baan Rim Pa and very pleased you enjoyed. The smog in the air outside is from fires in the north. fortunately it is a rarity..",
            "We were really looking forward to returning. Unfortunately the only redeeming feature was the view. The food was disappointing. I had the pineapple fried rice which was soaked in oil. My wife had the grilled fish and all you coul taste was the grill. We tried more than one white wine and they were all well overpriced for the quality. The service was lacking. The woman who should have been looking after us spent most of her time joking with the table next to us. We won't be returning.",
            "On thw rare occasions we receive a negative review, but we take it seriously. If there was a problem with the food or it wasn't to your liking, you should have advised the staff and they would have immediately changed it. I am sorry you felt the waitress neglected you, this is not normally a comment we receive. As for the wine. I believe our Wine Spectator awarded list has a good variety to choose from. Wines are expensive in Thailand as they are imported. Very sorry you will not return",

            "We booked this restaurant based on recommendation. Well what can I say.we attended this restaurant to celebrate my daughters 18th birthday with a party of 13. The waiting staff were very prompt with their service, the food was delicious and plentiful. They answered our request for water views and they delivered! Tee was ever so helpful, he ensured that we were happy and they even took a celebratory picture of our family to mark the special occasion and gave my daughter a gift. Communication via email was also very prompt. Thank you Tee and staff",
            "We are so happy the 18th Birthday was a success and you enjoyed Baan Rim Pa Hope to see you again one day.",
            "This was a special and delicious meal overlooking the sunset! The restaurant is situated right over the water so theres an incredible view of the sun going down if you get there in time. We got the green curry with beef, pork and basil, pad Thai with tofu, and local river fish - it was all delicious! We also got ginger and lemongrass ice creams, and bananas in coconut milk. Everything tasted great and was so fresh!",

            "When spending time in Old Phuket Town we decided to have a bite to eat mid morning at Phuketque. We had read somewhere about a dish they do which sounded interesting so we ordered it. Basically it is like a very thick toast bread soaked in caramel and butter then fried , then a dob of Madagascar Icecream was put on top. Different, it was very moreish, delicious, could have eaten another straight away. Only a small place, restricted seating and quite popular. Give it a try .",
            "A little gem of a find! Great menu, great coffee, great homemade lemonade. Great iced tea and iced coffee. Literally sat here watching the world in old town Phuket go by. Just the prices are bit High rest it's a great place to hangout,chill and relax.",
            "All staffs are unfriendly and ignorant to the customers. Don't see any smile from them at all and they keep chit chating with each other. The toast quality is also overrated. It's simply the toast with sugar and butter and nothing spectacular. Never return again",
            "they advertise Nutella and banana on the menu and turn around in true slight of hand style they substitute the knock off Ovaltine spread. the toast is nothing special and it is just to busy for my liking.",
            "An accidental chance-upon and we loved it! If you fancy After Yous desserts, you have to try Phuketiques and you probably will love it like we do :) May seem impossible to get a seat given the small area but the crowd moves relatively quickly.",

            "We were exploring old Phuket when we stumbled across this gem! There are queues of up to 30 mins for people waiting for their house speciality, the Burnt Butter Toast. A must try if you are in the area! The staff are lovely as well despite the queues!",
            "I think it is a Phuket landmark. It is the best french toast ever I would go back there just for the french toast. High quality ingredients. You should wait in a queue for this amazing french toast",
            "The place is too small to even see two people without a long wait. This fact they only tell you after you have paid. To add insult to the whole experience the cashier said we could not have their top-selling toast because they were out of their sugar honeycomb. Well, as the photo shows, they had boxes of the stuff on the prep counter. The desserts were overall quite average. Which we had to enjoy on a rainy afternoon on the sidewalk. Ill blah experience overall.",

            "In this restaurant they serve traditional thai dishes with a twist, that takes it to a new level The service is great and very personal. And the viewer just doesnt get any better. Thank you for wonderful evening. I will be back",
            "The best food, best service and best ambience with the ocean and beach views. The food here is awesome, great selection from the menu and best wine list. Come for a cocktail and then dine at one of the finest restaurants in all of Phuket",
            "Tried to make a reservation on line but website did not work. The setting is a perfect date night local over looking the waves crashing on the rocks below, but the food was a disappointment. For appetizers we had the yellow tail ceviche which was... melt in your mouth but fishy and over powered with the lemon taste. The Salmon was dry and the leek sauce did not have any flavor. The food was plated beautifully but I am sorry to say if I returned to Kata Noi area I would not return to this restaurant. More",
            "The food and ambience was absolutely amazing! The service and staff were so attentive and made the evening very special. The food is absolutely incredible - best spring rolls ever! It is a lot more expensive than other nearby places but the food and ambience... is worth it for a treat! More",
            "I had planned to visit this restaurant and got around to it on our last evening. A extended family of 9 we booked an early table as we have kids but also so we could overlook the sunset at this stunning location. Everything was great,... the staff, the menu, the food. All the ladies/girls got a rose after dinner which the little girls loved. My husband said that was his best dinner on the holiday. Everything was perfect. I would have come again if we had managed to come earlier in the trip. More",
            "Excellent place, everything is well tailored, the atmosphere, the view, the food, and the service. The best dining restaurant I've been to in Phuket",
            "What a lovely evening. Take in a cocktail. Move to the sunset view and take in the amazing sunset. Staff absolutely delightful. The beef cubes were so tasty. I then ordered lobster. Which again was cooked to perfection. Location overlooking the bay so nice. Picked... us up and dropped us home. What a lovely service. X highly recommend for dinner. X More",
            "Wow! Mom Tris is a gem! Wonderful scenic location overlooking Kata Noi beach. A superb restaurant - absolutely delicious food, friendly staff & a perfect location for romantic happy hour cocktails before dinner - 18:00 hrs to 19:00 hrs! A walk through the beautifully manicured... gardens to reach your table, with a view that does not disappoint! Try the Wagu steak cubed beef with mushroom for starters - a gastronomic experience! A little pricier than most restaurants here, but worth it! Comparable price wise, to a good restaurant in UK - 55 to 85 a head. Will definitely visit again when next in Phuket! More",
            "Delicious food in a very wonderful cliff top setting in a lush garden. The restaurant and hotel are very Thai in appearance and in a calm setting.",
            "Excellent food and service in the most beautiful setting nestled into the spectacular Moms Tri Villa resort. We stayed at the resort, and ate here three times it was that good! So many delicious Thai dishes to choose from. We had crab cakes, duck confit... with red curry, whole fried fish with chile sauce, lobster ravioli, pad thai, pad see ew. Each dish more delicious than the next. Excellent value for high end restaurant. Reservations a must. More",
            "The best place for dinner in Kata beach. The service is excellent, the menu is delicious and the food, wow! The place is unique, we were here twice during the week. I recommend",
            "I had an amazing birthday dinner here! The service was fantastic, the food was delicious, and the views of the sunset and the beach are amazing plus the resort is so gorgeous. Good to know: My daughter said she made reservations over a month in... advance as she heard this place is always booked and may not accommodate walk-ins during busy season (my bday is Dec 26). So just to be sure, reserve in advance! You wont regret it! Cost if youre wondering: for 5 people, 1 round of alcoholic drinks, 3 appetizer dishes to share and a dinner plate for each (5), we paid about 12,000 baht plus tip (so a little over $400 usd at the time of review). Not a lot at all for the quality of food you get it is soooo worth it! I highly recommend! More",
            "I have been here a few times when I have been in Thailand and it never changes. The food and the cocktails are excellent. The staff are very attentive and service is great. An absolute pleasure to dine there and overlook the ocean while we... sip on cocktails. More",
            "Really lovely restaurant with amazing view over Kata Noi beach. There was a very nice atmosphere at the bar with a live pianist playing, the food was very good and the service was polite and friendly, without being pushy. Its more expensive than other restaurants... in Kata but it feels much more high end so it was worth it. More",
            "We booked a table and said that we would come with a dog, we were told that the table was reserved, and when we arrived they told us that we could not go there because we were with a dog. Just horrible!"

            "The restaurant is beautiful...on the water with lovely chandeliers hanging in ivy filled trees....very romantic...we had a party of 18 and were waited on quickly. The food arrived before our drinks in most cases. They have a large, extensive menu consisting mostly of fresh fish, crab, lobster and prawn but do offer some vegetarian and chicken options. What a wonderful night we all had! Compared to other upscale restaurants in Phutek, this was very reasonably priced....with 2 fancy drinks, appetizer and two dinner meals our bill was $60 usd with tip.",
            "This must be some of the best food in earth - its all good but the clams in lemon grass soup is subtle, cleansing and very tasty. The drinks are amazing too, the staff are attentive and unobtrusive. An entirely enjoyable experience.",
            "Two Great dishes, one we did not like at all. Stir fried Crab Meat in yellow curry sauce with egg was outstanding. Stir fried Clams in sweet chile paste also delicious. Then the whole grilled Jack fish with tamarind sauce on the side came. It smelled awful and had no flavor. I'm sure it was just that we did not like that particular fish. We would definitely go back to the restaurant, but just order anything but the whole fish. Service wonderful. Giant place on the pier. Nice to be outside. Reservation to get a nice seat.",

            "Absolutely amazing restaurant, very good prices for the quality, authentic, music is not too loud but also not to quiet, there was live music when we were there, very nice. Incredible food, good quality and extremely fresh, would definitely recommend if youre going to Chalong, staff is also very nice og lights are cozy! 10/10",
            "Really bad running event. exactly what you would expect from a restaurant organising a marathon. Next time pay somebody who has experience to organise it for you. If you don't and you perform poorly, take responsibility for your mistakes! The staff smirk and patronise and offer no solution at all. If you treat people like this, don't be surprised when it costs you much more money in the long term.",
            "Went here for a lovely meal and wasn't disappointed. The service and the food were fantastic and we made 2 new friends, Tan and Kob, who could not do enough for us,, they are the best and I hope to see them again",
            "Great spot for lunch directly on the sea front, right by the pier! Value for money was incredible, and the food was similarly fantastic! Definitely would recommend to anyone in the Chalong area looking for brilliant Thai food! The beef sushi was particularly fantastic, along with the pork belly and chicken and cashews! Also, the tiger king prawns the best on the island!",
            "Serene seaside lunch, with excellent service, food and ambiance. Ate here after an early day at big Buddha (not too far at all!) Service was very attentive, but not at all intrusive everything we needed was always at hand. Food was as delicious as it was beautiful.",

Just a friendly reminder, if you are a new tourist who has just arrived Thailand, be careful and stay away from the fresh seafood and specially oysters, otherwise you'll regret for what you've done.",

            "Great atmosphere with traditional look! Hokkie noodles are basic dishes although those were the best I ever had! As well as Pak Ka Prao has a bit of chilli kick but tasted delicious. Really recommend to check this place out if you around told town.",
            "A great spot for lunch or dinner in old phuket town - very busy and therefore best to ring ahead and book a table. Sooo many options to choose from and all can be customised to your preference - including to be made vegetarian e.g. Tofu. We are a family of 5 and ate here on our last day - saving the best till last! We all enjoyed our meal and thai tea / coffees! :)",
            "We had such a great lunch experience at this place. The historic elements & fact that this was family house converted into restaurant only adds to the overall authenticity of the restaurant, as if the great food was not enough. The food is a blend of Thai, Chinese Hokkien and Peranakan cuisine. We enjoyed amazing massaman curry & pad thai, thai milk tea and blue butterfly pea ice tea. Regrettably, we did not try hokkien mee (noodles) which is their specialty. The whole atmosphere & vibe is really great - it makes it a perfect pit stop on a hot day. The staff is wonderful and super attentive. Don't miss it when you are in Old Phuket Town, it is truly a gem of a place.",
            "The food reflects a respect and an insistence of tradition, herbs, spices and long cooking time. The waitresses were also gracious and helpful. The drinks were also heartfully prepared, which is rare for a touristy district. For us, this beats the Michelin Guide place we visited last night by a mile. Two thumbs up for the combined experience of food, service, cleanliness, the entire experience and the value-for-money.",
            "We had the original noodle dish and i can taste the freshness of the ingredients but the flavor is nothing special as its a little mild for our taste. The old phuket town where this restaurant is nice to check out and definitely worth the drive.",

Not only delicious local dishes..especially loved the Massaman and the crispy wintins with Salsa starter, but my favorite of all was the Lychee Mojito soda( only 65baht!!!)so beautiful and refreshing that often I had 2. The staff are lovely, the history in the restaurant so intersting and the food delicious.The area is enchanting , very photogenic and well worth a visit.Highly recommend",

Theres always a line, as this restaurant is very popular, but it moves really quickly and you have many shops to see in the meantime. The restaurant doesnt accept any more costumers after 8pm so youll need to arrive around 7pm to get a nice table."

There are 2 restaurants up on the hill , and tried Tunk Ka . Good menu spread and tried the Braised Pork, Fish in Thai Sauce, Prawans and red ruby as dessert. Preferred Chang Beer as compared to Phuket Beer - to each his own I guess. Nice ambience and view. Staff are courteous . Transport is easy - Grab ! Well worth the journey to the restaurant.",

Whilst there we had an excellent dinner at the nearby Tunk-Ka Cafe (much more than a Cafe - check it out!) where our friends had booked a table on the external platform area. This is well worth doing not onl for the views but this is a very popular property. Both the service and food (Crab Curry in Coconut Milk, Prawns, Grilled Squid & Garlic and some delicious vegetables) were first rate. Indeed it proved a great setting for a most enjoyable evening - one we plan to repeat next year when the Tunk-Ka Cafe will be celebrating its 50th Anniversary!",

Soft shell crab ok. Chicken pineapple and cashews good. Then appetisers arrived! Tempura of prawn - inedible! Think warmed up! We were still eating when they literally pushed big dirty menus under our noses to see if we wanted anything else! Very untrained staff seemed to be in a rush to close! Terrible experience but great location! Wont be returning so many more deserving businesses of our custom!",

We had seafood dishes (the deep fried fish with sweet and sour sauce was excellent), fruit drinks and ice desserts. Absolutely no regrets coming here. Service was good and the cost very reasonable. And we actually put our Tunk-Ka Cafe experience here well ahead of our next day dining at the recognized Raya Restaurant in Phuket Town.",

If lucky, there will be a local singer performing and its fun. We ordered the Thai Iced tea, seafood noodles - both bang for the buck. The Iced tea tasted authentic. The path leading to the restaurant is also soulful.",
            "We had a very enjoyable lunch here: the food was delicious local cuisine, the views are awesome and the service was good.",
            "I found this cafe listed on an obscure website and chose to go because it was on the way to the Upside Down House. It was a complete delight. The views are great - we visited in the daytime but I can imagine the night time views are spectacular. The cafe itself is really nice, perched on stilts on the side of a steep hill, a little bit quirky and fun. Food was good with great dessert and ice cream choices (although we were told the kitchen was about to close after lunch). This would be my go-to meetup place with friends if I lived in Phuket. You do need a car to get here though.",
            "I have been so many times in Tun-ka Cafe over the years that I lost count. I have been there for group dinners with colleagues and with family and friends for casual gatherings. Each and every time, everything has been simply fantastic and amazingly consistent. Of course there is the location and the breathtaking views over the east and west coasts being on the top of a hill but more importantly the warm welcome, the impeccable (casual) service, the amazing food choice, the excellent food quality and authenticity. If you love genuine Thai cuisine, don't look further. Don't miss the Tom Ka Gai (I have never eaten a better one in Thailand), the Yam Won Sen seafood (seafood with angel hair noodles), the squids with garlic and pepper, any kind of fish and Thai curry. Food and drinks are very reasonably priced. Expect the place to be busy over weekends with lots of Thai people which is of course a great sign. I always go there for dinner but do not hesitate to visit it at lunch time if you want to take great pictures of the island, the view is amazing."

            "Had dinner with a group of 8 last Sunday. We ordered 2 bottles of wine, one bottle of Moet. So far so good. We have not been advised of pricing and only presented the food Menu. Food arrived after one hour. We ordered 2 half chicken, one tomohawk steak, mushroom soup and one fish of the day. Check out after somewhat 2 hours being presented with a 40.000 baht bill ( $1.734) I almost had a heart attack. I mean.. this isnt exactly the ritzy but Thailand. The Moet came to $550 whilst same is at any bottle shop at location just $90. The steak topped it and set us back $275. The fish I was meant to consume $125! Of 300g allegedly is home grown according to the advertising on their net based menu in some pond. Am not so sure, they also sold anywhere at the local fish market and is a common Pearch ( was undercooked too) All in all, the food wasent as good as promised prepared for a self proclaimed top star Restaurant. Iam taking actions now with the ARCOR group as owners. The restaurant manager was indisposed on holidays allegedly as I brought forward my complaint. I also had revisited to obtain a docket as we never received one at point of check out. This restaurant is a total utter rip off and unless you are a millionaire, they seem to get away with it. My advise dont even think about going there. We heard others in the hotel mentioning same issue over the Periode of our stay at the Avista. Iam not discriminating anyone, or anything. Just raising awareness of a massive overpricing.",

            "I bought about over 4000 thb worth of premixed curry kits. On the label it says it measures in GRAMS which is a measure of unit for solids. I asked a store assistant if it was just spices to make the curry and she yes. I to all those kits with me in my hand luggage on the plane to Chiangmai and they said that they were not sold but rather liquids and they were all destroyed and thown away while I was crying about it. Completely wasted almost 100 pounds which for me is a lot of money. Very disappointed in the labeling and assistance.",
            "Dear khun Laura, Thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention. We are sorry to hear about the difficulties you encountered with our curry kits during your travels. We aim to ensure our product labels are clear and helpful, indicating that the contents are measured in grams, a unit used for both solids and liquids to denote weight. Cooking sets are gathering several ingredients of different nature and it is best practice in our industry to use grams as units of measure, as per most international manufacturers. It's unfortunate there was a confusion about the nature of the contents, especially leading to such an upsetting experience at the airport. Our teams are trained to provide accurate information about our products. The explanation given by our sales assistant was in the sense that our curry kits are composed of all-natural spices, both dried and fresh, without any processed additives. The term \"spices\" was meant to distinguish our natural ingredients from those that are artificially processed, not to imply that the contents are entirely solid. For future travels, we recommend verifying whether packaged items meet the current airline regulations for carry-on luggage, as this can help prevent similar issues. I travel on a regular basis and whenever possible I pack most things in the checked-in compartment. However we would not like you to stay on this unpleasant note and if you can kindly share your phone number or email address we will reach out to you in the coming days to provide a care package so you still get an enjoyable taste of Thailand back home.",

If visiting Hooters in Thailand, I strongly recommend visiting this branch in Phuket, which is unquestionably best Hooters outlet in nation. One thing that differentiates Hooters Phuket from other Hooters restaurants in Thailand is consistent friendliness of servers and staff, not to mention high-quality food.

The best fish in tamarind sauce I have ever tried in Thailand so far. Excellent service and atmosphere too. Spacious interior. Good selection of wine. Perfect... place for dinner. More",

            "This restaurant is great not only for food but also has a very nice seating outside, full of orchids of different kinds. We were ordering delivery lunches from there - Staying at JW Marriott, it was much cheaper than to eat at the hotel. Delivery... over 500 baht is for free, they deliver to you security gate, send the menu and confirm the bill over whatsapp. Finally we wanted to see the place itself as well, and we were not disappointed. Totally worth the taxi fare from the hotel - we went there for dinner two evenings - what an amazing food. The owner greeted us as \"old friends\" due to our lunch orders ;). More",
            "5 out of 5 for the food and the service. The food was delicious and portions generous. The winged bean salad was an excellent starter and the beef stir fry with chilli garlic and holy basil a perfect main course . Recommended if you are... near Mai Khao . More",

            "Ordered delivery from Kin Dee as we usually did in all our previous meals. Some tips and observations: - delivery is free for orders more than 500baht. - delivery process to JW Marriott was very smooth. They ask for your last name and room number... and know the suitable back gates. Before delivery they call to let you know that the food is on its way (in 5 mins) - pre-orders for a specific time is possible! We timed our evening meal for after the happy hours and late afternoon swim and pre-ordered it before. Piece of cake! - restaurant website is tricky. All of us kept trying to get to the website and online menu. The links all lead you elsewhere. Ive attached the menu as photos for reference. When all else fails, give them a call. - orders can be done on verbally or via WhatsApp. We used WA which allowed us to check the final order and bill before confirming it. We love Kin Dee and Im so happy to see the menu and physical restaurant expanding! A Mai Khao institution. More",
            "The food quality is outstanding and prices are very affordable. A must visit. If youre staying at JW Marriott a return taxi is 500 THB. Well worth it. Strongly recommend the pork belly.",
            "We've ended up eating here three times in the last week...as we keep coming back for more! The food is great tasting and great value too across the extensive Thai menu. The staff are very friendly and efficiently go about their work looking after customers.... It was raining one evening and one of the staff came across the road from the restaurant with an umbrella to help keep me dry, which was a kind thing to do! Couldn't recommend the place more highly...probably going back for a fourth visit before our vacation is over too! More",
            "Very well executed Thai food, fresh and reasonably priced. Slightly away from the main hotel area, this is great local food at an affordable price. Many vegetable based dishes as well fish and meat. Banana blossom salad was my favourite of the evening.",

            "This is by far the best food and Thai food for the price in Mai Khao. The place is busy with well-to-do local Thai visitors so you will need to book. As a former MasterChef contestant, I loved this place. All the food is all... freshly made and lots of fresh fish too. Apart from the Marriott Ginga restaurant, all the others we tasted felt like bought in pastes and not freshly made. We ate at the Kin Dee 3 out of 8 nights it was that special. The food it is well priced. Two of us had a starter and main each, with a large beer each and one bottle of wine between two and it cost 55 or $60. From the Marriott, it costs 500 TBhat for a taxi round trip (there and back) so 12.50 or $14. The decor is nothing special but the food is great and Staff are friendly. We were here 12 years ago and the chef comes from an impressive background and she is still there. She ran the main Thai restaurant in the Marriott then left to start the Kin Dee. She then won the national all Thai cooking contest in 2008/9. Well worth a visit and the locals think so too. More"
