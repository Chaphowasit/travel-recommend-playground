            "A hoteliers review. Excellent place to stay! You cannot go wrong with this choice! It has possibly the best view in the whole of Patong! Dont miss the sunset view from the sky bar. They have a very friendly and hospitable team. Special shout-out to Pang from the pool who also doubles as a great kickboxing coach! Rooms have all the amenities one needs. We were travelling with a 2 year old child and they were supportive in every possible way and had anticipated for kids. They have a well equipped kids rooms along with planned activities. I appreciated the gesture of them comping our request for milk in the room for the child! Small gestures like this go a long way! Will definitely come back to this property and shall recommend it to friends and family.",
            "Overall an above average hotel. The staff, breakfast buffet and location are very good. The best strategy for food is to avoid anything that might be warmed or left over. We stuck with the freshly cooked omelettes and food that had high turnover. We were unsure if the dairy products or the warmed foods were freshly made or just held over. The pools are very nice but it gets crowded quickly due to limited seating. When we first arrived (Dec 2019) we were placed in room 402. Avoid all of Buiding #4. It is in close proximity to the main road. All night we were subjected to road noise, thumping music and the sounds of mopeds. It was truly awful. Room 402 also has holes in the patio doors and we were attacked by the local mosquitoes. We were moved to building #6 which is set back and it was a world of difference. The hotel is set on a hill above the main North-South road and adjacent to a very congested traffic circle. Housekeeping is hit or miss. The housekeepers do the bare minimum. They definitely make the beds but sweeping the floor and maintaining the bathrooms can be hit or miss.",
            "Out of the world resort in an out of the world destination. It is one of the best resorts I have visited in terms of hospitality. I had informed the property in advance that I am coming to celebrate my wedding anniversary and they made sure that they left no stone unturned. The staff is extremely warm and helpful and will make you feel at home. Buffet breakfast layout is good- reasonably ok for Indians as well. Rooms are huge with a great view. They upgraded the room for my special occasion and also had decorated my room beautifully, which was a lovely gesture. The property is located right in the middle of everything. The famous Patong Beach is at a walking distance and there is a free shuttle every 30 minutes to the Central Mall which is at walking distance from the famous Bangla Road. The only backdrop is that they will not provide you a room earlier than 2PM- which is their normal check in time. My trip was am extremely memorable one all thanks to the great Hotel and their amazing staff. Would recommend this hotel as the best and the biggest one in Patong! Thank you Novotel Phuket Resort team!",
            "I would like to begin my review with my praises. 1. The resort is at excellent location near Patong Beach. 2. Very good Shuttle services 3. Excellent Pools and nice nature looking rooms. 4. The pool access room is the best room. 5. The play area for kids and chef cooking for kids is a amazing experience. Some complaints. 1. The checkin process is delayed and we were offerred rooms only at 1400 hours. Rooms were offerred at 1410 after a upset mood discussion. 2. Some of the staff of the hotel is not very hospitable. 3. Staff and Bar and restaurants, bell desk are shared and hence you would be kept waiting. 4. The indian cooked food at breakfast is pathetic. 5. The maincourse is served in only 2 restaurants (Bar and Thai) while the coffee shop is almost everytime closed for lunch and Dinner. 6. Our drop to airport was confirmed but to our surprise when i checked on date of departure, i was told it is stil not booked. On manager intervention, the cars were booked. During departure, 1 van was missing from the two vans booked and we waited for 40 minutes before a car from travel agent was called. Completely non acceptable. 7. We were charged for complimentary meals and spa, and the charges removed when we proved to frontdesk that all these services were complimentary. 8. The hotel misses on airconditioning in common areas like lobby etc , considering it is very hot and humid in Phuket.",
            "Hotel is nice and clean, needs a bit of an update as things are quite dated. The breakfast area is not big enough when the hotel is sold out. Sometimes had to wait over 15 mins to be served. The pools are lovely but could do with being cleaned ore often due to leaves and flowers from trees falling into them. The room itself is spacious and comfortable. Lots of stairs so probably not a very disabled friendly hotel. Beach is just across the road from the hotel. You can book tours at the hotel reception and they also have a shuttle bus that runs you into the town if you dont fancy walking. A 15 mins walk and you will be at Bangla road, (night life/bars) or you can just jump on a tuk tuk.",
            "I stayed here for 2 nights in February 2020, and was pleasantly surprised with the size and quality of this beautiful hotel. It oozes class, and although I was a solo traveler, I would happily bring my wife and teenage kids here, knowing they would not be disappointed. The location of the Novotel is in the north part of Patong beach and whilst its still within this busy seaside town, the hotel situated in a very tranquil and carefully secluded hillside area. I travel to the UAE quite a lot, so have high expectations of reputable brands of hotels like the Novotel. Somehow, I wasnt expecting too much from this hotel in Patong, but was blown away with the beauty and the most amazing view as you walk into the hotel entrance and into the lobby. The architect no doubt focused on the view, and I can safely say you will be wowed when you see the view yourself. My deluxe sea view room was excellent, with a very cozy bed and all the amenities youd expect in a good 5 star hotel. Again the views of Patong beach are breathtaking from the balcony of the room, with beautiful red sky sunsets to look forward to in the evenings. There are 3 different pool areas, all offering different experiences and views with their own personal charms. The hotel can give you access to the beach road by walking down a few flights of stairs. The beach is a lovely place to walk down at night, with access to an array of shopping outlets and restaurants. Needless to say, staff and service was excellent, so I would definitely recommend if you like a bit of class. During my stay the hotel was dominated by European and Russian clientele, which may be because of the recent travel restrictions from China possibly? My only criticism of the hotel is that it has a very tiny gym, and only one shower in the mens changing room.",
            "If you get the chance of getting the room 911 ylang ylang dont feel panicky but you will have a lot of stairs and steps to do. Beautiful, large room with the AC placed in such a way that blows your head ( and mind too) but most of the times has no internet ( maybe due to corner position). Also a non functional TV but maybe because you are on holiday so de stressing is necessary. There is a shuttle which goes up and down from the reception to the entrance of the hotel but one needs to be happy to get it. A coconut might fall on top of your head but if you are really unlucky and occasionally admire some long ( I believe) garden snakes. But you are close to the beach again if you can cross the street safely",
            "Month late review... but I felt I needed to give a deserving review for this property. We stayed at Novotel Property late Dec to spend New Year 2019/20. For a first time visit to Phuket with family. We chose this Hotel for its location and positive reviews prior to our booking. Upon arrival we were greeted with warm and friendly staff which made us really comfortable and made check in swift. Particular thanks goes to NINA and SAI who were brilliant and accommodating. Our rooms were absolutely lovely, clean and presentable with ample of space for the whole family including our teenage boys. The views from the rooms were nothing shy of awesome. Being on a bed and breakfast basis stay we indulged in the odd other meal within the hotel vicinity and I must say the overall standard of food was very good including breakfast. To conclude, this hotel was lovely and perfect as a first choice hotel to stay. Location was good as it was slightly away from the busy hustle of the city not far by car, however its walking distance to the beach. Good thing the hotel provides regular shuttle services to Patong Central at no cost. Shuttles will also bring guests back at allotted times to the hotel. Personally for me, my stay exceeded my expectations as the staff, location and hotel made me feel welcome which leaves me with a no brainer that Ill definitely be a guest here again on a future trip to Patong.",
            "My family of 6 (including 2 children) stayed here for 5 days. We booked adjoining pool access rooms and the rooms were generally clean and I was happy to walk barefooted without bedroom slippers. 1.2m pool was great! Only inconvenience was lack of towels (since we had 3 pax per rm) and the floor mats which were always short after daily housekeeping. But, housekeeping was always quick on call. As we were at pool access, it made sense to have 2 per room (one for pool and one for bathroom door). A couple of towels had stains, but the rest were ok. Do check before use. Hotel was about 5 mins walk from Patong beach. Very convenient location! There is a 7-11 nearby and halal food around 15 mins walk away, towards the mosque. 15 mins walk in the opposite direction is the halal street food. There are several stations of halal food at the hotel breakfast restaurant too. The hotel had friendly staff like Kat, Jimmy and Peerawat. We were first served by Kat at the check-in counter who was very patient. Luckily, we had to wait for only 1 hour for the room to be ready as we were there before check-in time. Kat even took us to the rooms. Jimmy was ever helpful and friendly with making us feel welcomed and advising us on transport to the various places. Peerawat knows his routes well and usually gets us to destinations faster than expected safely. The traditional Thai massage at the spa was great. My therapist, Yu, magically removed the 'knots' at my shoulders. Will be back here again!",
            "This is not an easy review to write. .there were so many pros and cons. Firstly our pool access room was excellent (and on the ground floor, no stairs) and we recommend it highly because the pool was sited in the sun all day and was always warm. The room itself had an enormous bed which was very comfortable and because it was a deluxe pool access room it had a couch inside looking over pool and two loungers on the terrace .Housekeeping was done well and we certainly enjoyed the room service prawn cakes. We were given plenty of bottled water and pool towels. The shuttle service to the shopping centre was appreciated even though there was a big gap in the return times from 1600 onwards. So to the bad news.the reception staff had very poor English ad took ages organising our checkin.the breakfast was very ordinaryno fresh juices, fruit was unripe, stale pastries and serve yourself coffe.staff were slow in clearing plates off the tables and were not at all friendly. As we are Accor members we were offered a very disappointing complimentary afternoon teawe were expecting the cake stand as advertised on the hotel boards instead a disappointing arrangement of one savoury, sandwiches, unripe watermelon and a lurid square of cakewhat happened to the scones !? We feel this resort is let down by its food and the staff who are serving the clientsin the restaurant and the front desk. Perhaps putting up the daily rate would give a little more company profit to upgrade the food offerings in line with the delicious food from nearby resorts on the Patong Beach Road."

            "We have enjoyed our visit a great deal. The location is beautiful with a pristine beach, no hawkers, just guests and people living in the adjacent villas. The resort supports a turtle sanctuary. We saw a small turtle on the beach 100m from the hotel. As a green resort they have done well to limit plastic to a minimum ( note disposable chopsticks come in a plastic sleeve- paper should be used). Providing drinking water in recyclable glass bottles. There are fresh local vegetables and organic grains. Then the crowning glory is the spa which is truly world class. Compared to other lovely places we have visited in the Far East we have the following observations: Pool villas are lovely but many are overlooked by the staff accommodation. We rejected the first villa offered. A easy solution would be to use obscure or frosted glass on the staff windows but may still be unacceptable to some of the guests. I refused to use the outdoor whirlpool as there is a slimy line of green algae along the watermark which runs all the way around the pool. Our housekeeper is very considerate and brought extra water and towels when asked them kept up the supplies daily. The food is of a lesser standard compared to similar resorts with little variety apart from the daily specials. There are noticeable variations in the same dish ordered on different days. We opted for full board and most evenings the Natai is almost empty as most guests go out to eat. The staff are very friendly and helpful in both restaurants. There is no bar in the hotel as the shutter is broken at the Edge and the pool bar is not in use. It means for the pre dinner drinks we have to find a sofa on the beach if vacant or use a table which may be annoying for other guests who want to have dinner. There is a mishmash of beach furniture as it seems the resort has run out of the brown metal and nylon sun loungers and borrowed some white PVC loungers with blue mattresses from the Akyra which is the lesser sister hotel. The WiFi is intermittent and weak. After a few frustrating days the reception team fixed a 4G personal WiFi which is perfect. We found the staff at reception very helpful and efficient whenever there is a query or request. Now for the spa. The team are well trained with some therapists speaking quite good English. The space is beautiful in design with many lovely details as clearly there is a sense of offering the best experience to the customers. For the lovely treatments we have enjoyed I will not hesitate to come back again.",
            "We stayed for 8 nights on a bed & breakfast basis in an Ocean Loft Suite and experienced a really great short break vacation. For us, a mature couple from the UK, the resort met all of our needs and more. It was quiet, contemporary, spotlessly clean and the beach is just stunning with a gentle pure sandy slope into the waves, no hawkers, no litter, no seaweed and no people!!! The food is \"top notch\" and across the two restaurants we did not have to repeat any lunch or dinner dish twice......such was the choice. It has to be said that the cost of alcohol is high in most resorts and here this is no exception. However the wine quality and choice was excellent. The Spa facility is also of the highest standard. It is easy to find faults in any resort but here ALL of the staff were quick to respond and correct the few minor irritations we found....none of which negatively impacted on our stay. We will return.",
            "Our family of five stayed at Aleenta for 5 days including New Years Eve. The property is 25 minutes north of Phuket but seems to be a preferable location given the size and beauty of the beach. We made the reservation late and as a result stayed in two deluxe pool villas which were not beachfront but nonetheless were stunning and peaceful. Each one room suite opened onto a sunny pool which was lit at night. The room, bathroom and pool are beautifully designed. The entire property is beautifully designed and includes two restaurants, a spa, a fitness center and a store. The beach is the crown jewel of the property. Every morning we were able to run as the sun was rising in the sky. The resort has a barefoot chic atmosphere with high design but friendly unpretentious service. The price point was fanstastic. We highly recommend the property for families or couples.",
            "My partner and I traveled from the US and Philippines to meet in Thailand and had to book the 14 day ALQ package upon arrival. After researching for months, this Grand Deluxe Pool Villa package was the best I found, in terms of room quality, private pool access and the ability to go to the beach for an hour a day. Before arrival the customer service agent was so amazing and helpful when it came to applying for visas and always checking in with me & responded instantly (thank you Pat). During our stay the staff worked so hard to make it perfect, even though they are operating at less staffing capacity due to covid (We loved Nui and Wai). The food is healthy and tastes fresh, large portions and always delivered promptly (even in the pouring rain). The resort was clean and felt very safe; its definitely a more secluded area and the beach on either side was totally empty. Initially, I thought $6k for two weeks was a bit steep, but after our stay at Aleenta I feel that it was completely worth it! Great for couples and felt very romantic.",
            "We booked grand deluxe pool villa which was wonderful due to the privacy and it was very modern. But it felt to far away from the beach and u had to cross the road to get to the beach, restaurant and spa. They always had guards standing next to the road to help u cross and check the traffic which was very good and u always feel secure. We wanted to be closer to the beach so we upgraded to the one bedroom residence which was beautiful with 3 balcony where u can sunbathe all day and have a great view of the beach and the ocean. U also had your own private pool also facing the beach. Food was amazing, big thanks to the chef who always made new innovative dishes.",
            "Its really a lovely resort with spacious villas. We had a 4-bedroom villa so lots of space for our family. The room initially had a damp smell but that could have been because of the quiet period of the pandemic. Anyway it cleared up after a day or so. The private villa pool and the amazing access to a lovely private beach is unbeatable. The sand is soft and fine so no water shoes are needed. However the location is quite remote so its very quiet. A trip to Phuket Old Town took us more than an hour to get there and that simple visit took the whole afternoon. The restaurant Edge is very good but we did want to try other restaurants and had to drive to Mai Khao area which is about 20+ minutes away.",
            "It's wonderful hotel. We stayed in a villa with swimming pool and it was lovely. The staff is very nice and attentive, everybody, gardeners, drivers, housekeepers, breakfast staff... The room was cleaned twice a day, the beach is beautiful and completely empty and the swimming pool delightful with views over the beach. Breakfast is insanely good. They have two restaurants but only The Edge was open, the food is delicious although a bit overpriced. There are local places around way cheaper with very good food and drinks and nice people as well. My advice is to enjoy the hotel bar and restaurant but to contribute to the local economy by going to the small restaurants and stores in the area.",
            "Recently stayed with my family (4 adults and 2 children) for 4 nights at the wonderful Aleenta Phuket. WOW what a place. We stayed in a Beachfront 3-Bedroom Private Pool Villa (Villa 550) and it was so amazing. Absolute privacy, both around your private pool and also on the private beach, which is one of the most beautiful beaches weve stayed at. We stayed on their All Inclusive basis, which include gourmet dishes - both in a thai and an international restaurant with everything from pizza to rock lobster, amazing cocktails and on top of that up to 2 hours of spa/massage pr person pr day. An absolute Pearl just 25 mins north of Phuket Airport, where privacy and luxury is your priority. Hope to be back some day!",
            "This review is about the stay at Grand Deluxe Pool Villa. 1) Arrival Airport transfer was pre-arranged, the driver greeted us with our name card at the Phuket airport. It took about 30 minutes to reach the resort from the airport. Once we reached the resort we were greeted by the staff and went through the check-in process that was seamless. 2) Grand Deluxe Pool Villa The villa is just the right size at 140sqm offering plenty of space for a couple and the private pool is quite large as well. The palms and lush greenery certainly add to the tropical vibes holiday and we could easily spend most of our day at the villa enjoying in-room dining and sipping wine. In addition, you can literaly walk into the pool directly from the bedroom. The villa also offers complete privacy if you prefer to sunbathe topless. 3) Breakfast A large hotel chain may offer a larger spread of choices for a breakfast buffet but we found that the a la carte breakfast menu at Aleenta Phuket Resort & Spa had plenty of choices and you can order as many dishes as you want. It's a different type of experience, so that is entirely up to your preference. For this trip we aimed to have a more private stay and also had a very nice floating breakfast served at our villa. 4) Spa and Yoga There is a dedicated Spa at the resort and I can recommend the aroma oil message that was very relaxing and comparable to other top spa experiences we've had in Thailand. For a bit of exercise and and felixibility exercise we booked a Yoga session which was just as great. 5) Beachfront area, main pool and restaurant The resort also has the main large pool where you can enjoy cocktails and gaze into the sunset. Restaurant is next to the main pool and a romantic candle light dinner can be arranged on the beach as well. In summary, I think the stay at Aleenta Phuket Resort & Spa was well worth it, I think it is especially suitable for couple's who are looking for a private getaway offering a lage private pool villa and I will certainly be returning for another holiday.",
            "The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was a villa with a pool which was lovely except that the two halogen lights in the ceiling were at the foot of the bed not the top, so there was no light for reading at night. They really need to add lamps to get to keep 5 stars. The rooms and the property were very well maintained. The food was good quality and comparable in taste to the local restaurants [although like all hotels more expensive]. The beach was lovely, extremely clean and uncrowded. The hotel wasn't that crowded when we were there [no Chinese because of coronavirus] so there were enough chairs. If the hotel was more crowded chairs would have been a problem. The desk was helpful in making any arrangements you wanted. All in all it was a delightful hotel."

            "Stayed 4 days in a 2 Bedroom Island suite facing the lake. It was beautiful and blissfully quiet with nice birdsongs in the morning. Breakfast at Market Place had a good spread and breakfast at Bodega Grill offered a more peaceful serene option by the pool. Plus theres an ala carte menu. Tried the steak n eggs, grilled salmon n rice, waffles. Nice beach n pool but we didnt try it as it was rather crowded and noisy due to a 2 day Indian wedding. Was glad we had a room away from the wedding. Had a special surprise birthday cake and towel arrangement on my moms birthday. We didnt tell the hotel about it but they must have noticed it from the passport. Good catch and nice surprise! All the staff were very polite and pleasant. Special thanks to Tuang for her recommendations on food, spa, transportation and activities.",
            "3 years after our last visit, Michal & his wonderful team have made our week long stay at the beautiful Angsana on the amazing Bang Tao Beach. The moment we arrived we were welcomed back & after a speedy check in we were escorted to our massive 1 bedroom loft room over looking the lagoon. Our visit was to celebrate my wife's birthday & we were thrilled to find a bottle of champagne on ice ready to celebrate. Bang Tao beach is so nice, stunning powder soft sand with sparkling ocean water was prefect for our morning 6km walks. To the right of the Angsana are numerous beach front restaurants that provide an alternative to in resort dining or to drink a cocktail or more whilst watching the stunning sunsets. Our dinner tonight at the resorts Bodega & Grill was one of the best dining experiences we have had...anywhere! The Surf & Turf share platter for 2 was enormous & well worth the money particularly if you love eating like we do. Michal & team thank you for making our returned stay so relaxing & memorable. Despite the ongoing global issues with corona virus, your team went to great lengths to make us feel safe. We eagerly look forward to returning",
            "Well situated hotel if you want to avoid the hassle of central Phuket. Good swimming pool and a good beach front area with lots of sun beds. I would prefer more shade at the beach area to stay away from the sun during the hot hours. Breakfast room is very noisy if you come in late 9-10. Room was spacious and clean. We did have a low water pressure in the shower and it took the engineer 3 visits to have it fixed. There is a building operation going on at the north western part of the hotel, near the beach. You would like to avoid the rooms in that area for now. Rooms that have a direct pool excess should be avoided if you dont have young kids as this part of the pool is used mainly by kids and families.",
            "Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here in a spacious Premier Room. It is rare to find a room that can sleep 2 adults and 2 children with still plenty of space & not needing an additional bed so this was a great find. The beds were super comfortable and it was very quiet in the room. Current construction is only on the beach and it's a large and very spread out resort so we were not impacted by that at all. Photos of the gardens and pool area don't do it justice. The gardens are impeccably maintained. There was a temporary blow-up slide there for the kids, pool games, aqua aerobics. Swimming through the lazy river to reach the quieter pool beside Bodega & Grill was so peaceful and relaxing. The resort also fronts onto the beach. You can walk to other resorts via the beach pathway & past local market stalls (massages, hair braiding, drinks, pool toys), or by boat at the lagoon which is slow but a novelty. There's also a free shuttle bus to the other Laguna resorts. Food by the pool was good, and even better that kids eat free throughout the resort when adults purchase a meal. Bodega & Grill was amazing, best Italian I've tried in Phuket, absolutely loved it! Beautiful lagoon setting at Marketplace for breakfast which was very busy yet runs like clockwork. Staff do an amazing job in this busy and demanding environment. We found Xana Beach Bar to be the weakest of their restaurants, great atmosphere but worst food and service, and yet most expensive. Before staying I wondered whether this secluded part of Phuket would make for an uninteresting stay, but it was the opposite. There's a weekly open air movie night, a street food market by the pool with live music, fire show by the pool. These have great atmosphere and kept our evenings interesting. The level of service throughout the resort was 5 star & very good (except at Xana). Our room wasn't flawless, there were ongoing electrical issues and our front door got jammed at times - minor things but staff sent an engineer after we raised it. The only other disappointment was the kids club. Staff there are amazing, however the rooms were very bare with empty shelves unlike in the photos. Also, such a large resort yet only 2 nannies to take kids younger than 4. This means they're almost always booked & it's hard to find a suitable time. Staff did their best to accommodate us though, however they should ideally have more nannies on call. Otherwise we loved the resort!",
            "We were lucky enough to stay in a 2br pool suite, lagoon view for 9 nights which we booked directly through the hotel via email. The booking process was very professional and responsive and we were offered a good package deal. The oversized apartment was jaw dropping. So much room for our family of 3. Beautiful, clean and new with everything you may need during your stay. The Private infinity pool was immaculate and had great sun coverage for most of the day as well as a lovely view of the lagoon. The location was lovely, right on the beach, except for our visit in the wet season the beach was closed for swimming. The Laguna complex provides a shuttle bus to all internal hotels, and a lagoon boat to a few spots. It would be good if the shuttle extended into town, at least for drop offs. They have just introduced a shuttle to Patong which was easy to use and affordable. Unfortunately, a concierge service was non-existent and a bit of a letdown. As first-time guests to Thailand, we were hoping for some advice and guidance on things to do and see, local restaurants to eat at as well as how to get to places. This service just wasnt available. This was also evident at check in, where we were not informed of the amenities or that we could dine at Bodega for breakfast instead of Market Place as we were staying in the Beachside residence. We have to give a special mention to 3 staff members that went above and beyond for us during our stay. Ammic at reception, and June in the MarketPlace were both amazing. Ammic was the first to help us with booking tours, making restaurant reservations and accommodating our every need. June made breakfast so enjoyable. Nothing was too difficult, and she was always willing to make us as comfortable as possible. She was fantastic with our young son, always doting on him. Another special mention goes to Rey from housekeeping who was kind enough to leave our son a colouring in book one morning after seeing his pencils on the table. The restaurants were unfortunately one of the areas that let this resort down. It may be because we travelled in the off season, that minimal restaurant choices were available. The food regrettably lacked variety and flavour. The food and drinks at Pool Side took a long time to come out with our order being cold and soggy by the time we received it. It was also apparent that the hotel uses the off season to train new staff as this was discussed in numerous areas throughout the hotel and may have contributed to our restaurant experience. Overall, the hotel was probably more suited to returning guests or those that have been to Thailand before and not wanting to go and explore. We had a pleasant stay, loved our apartment but think with a bit of tweaking, this hotel could be taken to the next level.",
            "I stayed in Angsana Laguna Phuket for a little over two weeks, actually extending my stay for a few extra days, so that I could continue to enjoy my time in Phuket. I stayed in one of the Pool-Laguna view rooms, and had lots of space and a very nice balcony. The room was cleaned very well each day, and as I often requested a bucket if ice, there would be one left in my room on many days - without me even asking. The breakfast buffet provided each morning was very good, with a variety of choices, including an eggs/omelette station, which is always my favorite! The amenities at the hotel were superb, with a variety of pools and located right on Bang Tao Beach - a long stretch over 7 km. I used the fitness room several times, and also really enjoyed paddle boarding around and through four different lagoons, all connected together on both sides of the hotel. I also requested and was able to use one of the meeting rooms for a zoom fitness group class, which I led on three different days. There were also a variety of options for dinner, including a great spot on the beach from which to see very nice sunsets on some evenings. Overall, I would highly recommend the hotel for individuals, couples and families. There is something for everyone there. I will look forward to returning to Angsana Laguna on my next visit to Phuket!",
            "We enjoyed the property with a few negative experiences Pros : Beautiful property and rooms Good buffet breakfast (but you are thrown out at 10:30 am) Lots of activities for kids (My Kids loves the play area / Tree House area) Direct beach access with ample sun beds Beautiful pool area (Beach feel) for those who want a safer environment to play in water with kids Bellboys were very helpful. 5 different dining options Sunken floor bath tub isnt for all but our kids loved it. Cons : Bad checkin experience - You need to pay a deposit (Not leave your card details, actually pay) at checkin to be able to bill any F&B to your room. A bit irritating. Rooms were assigned in an area near construction zone and was very noisy during the day Beverages ordered at the pool were spilt while serving and not replaced. The staff just vanished leaving an empty coconut for the kids to look at! Staff pass comments in the local Thai language while talking to guests which makes guests feel uncomfortable. A bit of Hospitality training is definitely necessary. The skirting of the corridors need thorough cleaning. A bit expensive but I can imagine the fixed costs of running such a family must be astronomical!",
            "We are now at home after another fabulous holiday at the Angsana. From checking in right through to handing our keys back it was another great experience. Nothing was a problem, the staff are all very friendly and are delighted to be of assistance whenever they can. We stayed in a one bedroom loft overlooking the lagoon, very comfortable with every thing you need. As returning guests it was good to see the amount of familiar faces among the staff, they recognised us and welcomed us like old friends Hotel Manager Michal and his management team were also very visible during our stay and were happy to chat at any time which added to the sense that we were very much valued as customers. We chose the Angsana again as we feel very comfortable knowing were everything is means we can get on with our holiday immediately. The food is always very good at the Angsana, breakfast sitting outside overlooking the lagoon is a delight. The Ban Talay restaurant is very good, the set dinner is excellent value as gives you a taste of traditional Thai food in a first class setting. Overall the Angsana is a great hotel to enjoy a holiday in Phuket, it is family friendly but also has the space to find quiet spots to chill out within the grounds with access to the pools never more than a few steps away",
            "We stayed here at the beginning of July during Phuket Sandbox. The first 3 nights we stayed in a 2 bedroom pool suite room in the new area of the hotel. It was simply incredible; the lagoon views, the glass pool on the balcony, furnishing and the space. So much space for a family of 4. The next 4 nights we stayed in a 2 bedroom lagoon view room in the original part of the resort. We had a large living space, dining room table, small kitchen and 2 ensuite bedrooms. Again ample space for a family of 4. The pool is like a river so you can dip in and out at any point, the kids club was open (the outside areas) which the kids loved and we were able to leave them there to go and have a couples massage - they were well looked after with arts and crafts and a big playgroud - what a treat!! It was amazing. Xana Beach Club was the only restaurant open for dinner at this point but they had a different themed night each night - the seafood BBQ and charcoal night were incredible value and so good. Also the a la carte options great. Breakfast at Market Place had lots of options, kids looked forward to the pancakes daily. It is on Bang Tao beach which is beautiful, quiet, clean and the sunsets out of this world! The staff couldn't do enough for us, they were helpful and service was great. Very happy we chose the Angsana for the start of our trip to Phuket. Thank you!",
            "We decided to travel to Phuket with a degree of trepidation given the covid situation worldwide but we are so thankful that we elected to come. From the minute we stepped through the doors at the hotel we were blown away by the welcome from staff who immediately brought refreshments & sorted our room despite arriving early morning. We should also add that the staff were following a strict hygiene regime which was extremely reassuring. We stayed in a one bed loft build over the lagoon and we were overwhelmed by the views from the two balconies, the fully equipped kitchenette and the air conditioned bedroom on the upper floor. The bedding is superb & we found it difficult to drag ourselves to breakfast. The quality of food and beverages was also excellent particularly the choice at breakfast and barbecue on the beach. It was my husbands birthday whilst here and he was really touched by the complimentary cake and fruit platter which were left in our room. Towards the end of our stay we were dismayed to have our return flight cancelled. Reception staff and management could not have been more helpful & quickly leapt into action to secure an extension to our existing accommodation. A special mention to Helena and Ann - what a wonderful team. We will definitely be back as this hotel is outstanding Nick & Tina Bonner"

            "We stayed in a standard room for 8 nights and for the most part enjoyed our stay. Our room was in the main block room 1517 (5th floor which was top) and suffered with noise coming from room 1515, these rooms had an internal door (most likely for the cleaners to use or possibly to allow families to have adjoining rooms) which was allowing the TV, music, voices etc. to be heard at all hours of the night. After putting up with this for 3 nights we went and complained to the reception desk but were asked to call them if it happened again which it did the next night at gone 1am so they were called and said they'd send someone but I'm sure they just called the room as I heard their phone ring, next morning I went back to reception, they moved us to room 1506 which had no internal door and there was no more noise problem. Other than the above, the rooms were good and appear to have been recently refurbished but the beds a quite firm and none of these rooms had a balcony or view. The breakfast buffet was good and loads of options to cater for everyone but we didn't eat any other meals in the hotel as we preferred to go to the nearby restaurants. The rooms we stayed in are in the main block which also has the roof top pool and we only used this pool during our stay, the other main pool looked busier with families but as ever getting a provided beach towel and reserving sunbeds before 9:30am was a must. The roof top pool was clean and regularly checked for PH levels etc. The hotel is in a good location with just a short walk to the main area and walking street but not too close and it's directly opposite the beach, it also has some shops, bars & restaurants at the front and rear of the building. The hotel has quite a grand feel to it in the main foyer but it really needs renovating, even just re-painting would help and also the gym could really do with an upgrade, it's fairly small given the size of the hotel and could do with some additional equipment. The wifi worked fine in the rooms and in the restaurant but by the roof top pool it wasn't always available which really shouldn't be that difficult to fix. Overall we'd possibly use this hotel again but probably wouldn't stay for so many nights as we also stayed in nearby Karon beach which is only a 15min drive away.",
            "stayed there twice, great location - right on the beach within walking distance to everything. Friendly staff, rooms cleaned each day, good beds, TV, free wifi etc. Western & Thai food for breakfast & plenty of choices. they cater for children well with activities etc which for a single bloke was the only annoying feature - but easily avoided by going out during the day. Security keep an eye on the place & no rowdy tourists etc after 9PM so can get a good night sleep. First stay was in more expensive rooms, 2nd stay was cheaper room (couldn't tell the difference in room quality) except it was next to the pool so if you are in your room during the day (to avoid the heat) - bit of noise from guests / children using the pool but nothing excessive. At the end of the beach so no better way to start the day than with a walk along the beach before the heat (& tourists). Street vendors on the beach just outside so cheap lunch available",
            "If you are considering to stay at this resort Id only recommend booking the sunset deluxe pool access rooms, as the rest of the resort is sadly a little tired. Although our room was very clean, the access to the pool required considerable maintenance, as it has missing tiles and the spa had non functioning jets in more than half of the area of the spa section. The pool itself in the sunset section is a good size and although it was clean on most days there were a couple of occasions where we observed faeces and tissue paper drifting about the water near our room, which made us think twice about taking a dip. The main spa in the sunset section is non operational and the sun loungers are tired with many missing wheels and deflated cushions. The sunset rooms balcony access to the pool is very slippery when wet and no steps are proved to enter in and out of the pool, making it a little dangerous. (they ask you to sign a waiver upon check regarding any accidents you may encounter in the pools). The reception staff are a little unwelcoming upon arrival, with the overall process being slow and unorganised, especially if you have just endured an 8 hour flight. Over my many trips to Phuket over the last 15 years I have always been very warmly welcomed and offered a cool drink/towel at check in, sadly not here where you are directed to take a seat in the lobby and wait an unacceptable time to be assisted. The breakfast buffet does not offer enough tables to accommodate the large resort and on most mornings our party of guests had to clear up others grotty plates, in order to secure a seat. The selection of food is large but unfortunately of low quality compared to other, less expensive resorts I have stayed at in Patong. If I stayed here again Id forego adding breakfast and go elsewhere to eat. On a positive note the beds and pillows are very comfortable and we had fresh, clean linens provided daily. The rooms are large and the bathroom/shower facilities are of good quality. The beautiful Thai lady who cleaned our room did an exceptional job every day, which made our stay more enjoyable. There is fantastic air conditioning in the rooms and the balconies are large and shaded. The security team at the front entrance are terrific people who always offered a friendly greeting with a smile and made us feel safe within the resort, as did the grounds, cleaning and pool staff. With some improvements to the check in processes, maintenance/fabric upgrades and food service (breakfast) this resort has the potential be amazing.",
            "We were a group of 11 (two families - parents with kids ranging between 15 and 20 years). We booked 5 rooms and stayed for 14 days. The hotel is in a good location, approx 10-15min walk from Bangla road and directly across the road from Patong Beach. The hotel offers different daily exercise classes at 9:30am (ie: pilates, yoga, strength etc) and a variety of pool and kids club activites (Monday through to Saturday). The hotel gym is well equipped and there are plenty of restaurant/cafe options, pools and several swim up pool bars. Whilst the pools and surrounding areas (including the pool towels) are in need of updating and refurbishment, they are clean and maintained throughout the day. There is also a spa, gift/beauty shop, tour office and business rooms/facilities available although we did not need to utilise any of these. In general, we found all of the staff friendly and accommodating particularly the housekeeping and maintenance staff. Breakfast had a great variety although the main restaurant was very busy between 9am-10:30am where it was difficult to get a table. However, you can always eat at the Sunset Restaurant for breakfast and we never had any trouble getting a table here. We would agree that the hotel is quite outdated, run down and in need of maintenance altough we noted that renovations/refurbishments were taking place while we were there. Our friends rooms (Deluxe rooms in Block 3) had been updated however we were in Block 4 (pool view rooms that were interconnecting) and our rooms had obviously not yet been done as they were outdated, had very poor Wifi in the rooms and our TV did not work very well. However, the rooms were clean, relatively spacious and had everything we needed. Housekeeping also did a fantastic job of cleaning our rooms everyday and replacing our towels (and bed linen if requested). Overall, we found this hotel good for the price and location and we would stay again.",
            "Having stayed here for 10 nights I can absolutely recommend Graceland resort and spa, having read some if the negative comments we weren't to sure what we were getting into but don't believe what you read make your own mind up. First up we arrived in Phuket early got to the hotel at 9am usually check in is 3pm but they had our room ready for 11am and we had a full day so they were very helpful friendly and polite the reception staff were always outstanding the 2 times we met them check in and out. We booked a pool view deluxe room facing the left hand pool and it was more than suitable great view Aircon etc no mini bar but that's easy fixed 2 bottles of drinking water topped up every day. There is 4 pools at least here and they are brilliant our pool which has to be at least 100 metres long was stunning a real tropical setting with a pool bar 2 pool bars in the hotel could have stayed here forever really top class,also have your breakfast at the sunset restaurant far better than the main breakfast area breakfast there starts at 7am any drinks lunches etc where real good Graceland is right across the street from the beach and dozens of street food stalls they are all cheap and brilliant come with a brilliant view as well. Only a few negatives not enough sunbeds they need replacing you'll most likely have to sign in each day to the WiFi I usually turned it off and on and it worked fine you'll see the odd broken tile or areas that need a lick of paint these are all small niggles don't let it put you of this is a great hotel with a location to match highly recommended we'll definitely be back next year.",
            "This hotel even though is a 5 star hotel is far from it. It all starts when you enter the premises without anyone check if you are or not a customer. In the reception some of the personnel does not speak English, no problem with that as far as these employees only attend Thai. Some of the places are not impeccable needing some maintenance. Tables in the middle of the corridors, like a warehouse, is not appropriate. All our stay where nearby the bowling premises. Growing plants in vases to put later in the gardens is OK but not in the areas where customers walks. Allowing adults laying down in the sofas in the lobby unacceptable. Some employees never stand up when we address them, for example collecting the swimming pool towels. The only meals I had were breakfast. Even though there were many options, in same areas like cheeses fruits and bread pretty limited. No one, also here, was checking who were we when entering to have the meals.",
            "We stayed in a pool access room for the second time this year and had another wonderful stay. Whilst we dont eat here outside of breakfast we loved our room which was the same one as we had in May. Whilst Id paid for the sunset room I swapped on arrival as I prefer the share and access steps into this pool better. I felt the sunset room has no steps to get in/out at your pool so for me I prefer just stepping into the pool as I like to lounge on my patio beds. Again the staff were amazing, everyone remembered me from May. Check in/reception excellent and accommodated a late check out to 5pm because we fly at night. Breakfast is the best in patong and the staff made all my food fresh and kept fruit for me aside every morning as I have food allergies. Even when I missed breakfast I woke up to my regular meal at our door, thats how wonderful they were. Room attendant for house keeping did a great job, I always tell them our needs at the start and she did this every day to a high level of service. Whilst the locations a little bit further on the beach front gracelands pools are spectacular and we loved our time here.",
            "I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a fun stay in Phuket close enough to the action but far enough away if you dont want it on your doorstep. The best thing about this hotel is the entertainment staff, Asha, Kelvin and Dino, our two girls absolutely loved spending time with you three doing the activities and you guys always had time for them keeping them smiling they miss you all and you made the holiday special for them so thank you so much! The pools were great, the open space lawn area great for the games and activities, the bowling was a nice option to have and the food at the sunset bar was very good. The rooms were cleaned every day, I accidentally left the do not disturb light on and turned it off at 3pm when I popped to the room for something one day and did not expect to come up at 5pm and it was still cleaned so was very happy at that! I know how hard housekeeping is so thank you to the staff for that. Breakfast was standard and really the only criticism I could have if being picky was the hotel was a bit tired in places maybe needs a bit of an upgrade here and there but it didnt matter to us too much. The other restaurant at the beach front also maybe could have done with being upgraded a bit to look more inviting we didnt eat there as it didnt really appeal to us as it didnt look great but has a lot of potential facing the beach. We would stay here again in back in Phuket.",
            "Stayed 12 nights with a group for a 60th birthday. I found the hotel way too large for what Id normally book & it was extremely busy when I stayed. If you have a bad sense of direction like me, its easy to get lost. The room: 2328 (building 3, 2nd floor) bed was very comfy, there was a Queen & a double bed in our room. Pillows were awesome. We had a huge bath which I loved. Lovely shower with overhead shower head or use the wall shower head. The usual supplies of bottled water daily, shampoo/conditioner, soap etc. safe in the room, had bath robes & slippers (we didnt use). Had trouble working the light switches every night .. youll know what I mean if youve stayed here! The pools: were all lovely. You can get drinks at the pools and only 2 have a swim up pool bar. I think a couple had toddlers areas. They have happy hour 4-6pm with delicious cocktails! Breakfast: Very busy but lots of good choices to suit all nationalities. We sat outside a couple of times. I heard you can have the same breakfast at Sunset Restaurant too (would be a better choice overlooking the beach) Location: Across from the beach where you can hire beach chairs all day for 100 baht. Its a bit of a walk to Bangla Rd & theres the usual 7 eleven, massage places, shops, restaurants pretty close by. 200 baht for a Tuk Tuk to go anywhere in Patong. Out in the lane way theres a lady with a cart making banana pancakes, do try one! Theres also a couple of little restaurants & a massage place where you can get your laundry done really cheaply.",
            "Phuket Graceland is like a tropical garden by the Andaman Sea. There were so many plant species around the hotel buildings that I often used the Google picture search function to find out what they represented. The hotel has several pools, including a rooftop pool that gives the impression of continuity with the main pool and the sea. The sea is just across the street and there are many street vendors selling traditional Thai food. Crossing the street from the hotel to the sea was not straightforward, as pedestrian crossings mean nothing to local drivers, but during certain hours an employee of the hotel was sitting there with a red flag to stop the traffic such that guests could cross. My room was located in the Sunset Deluxe area and I really appreciated its design and the smart TV with YouTube access, though the TV remote control was a bit weird (I found my way with it mostly by hazard). I also liked that breakfast was served from 6 am, which was very practical for guests who like me left very early on day trips to the islands. Cocktails were very cheap by European standards. The maracuja one is worth trying, they use real fruits and not syrup as in other places. A mention also for the hotel staff, as they were very professional and helpful. I saw that many of the previous comments were complaining about the old state of the hotel. That is true, but extensive renovation works are underway. Some buildings had already been repainted and the pool bar in the Sunset area is brand new. I will probably return to Graceland to see the results of the renovation works."

            "Vegetarian family of 4 from Sydney, Australia. We booked a room with a plunge pool and club lounge access both of which we did not regret. Check in was easy. We were guided to private check in at the club lounge. The club lounge offers exclusive access to a quiet lounge, breakfast, midday soup, afternoon snacks and evening cocktails. It never seemed busy. Pay looked after us by ensuring there were some vegetarian options. The other hidden benefit of the club lounge was getting two items laundered for free each day. Staff are all very friendly. There are multiple pools. A large family pool with swim up bar. Smaller kids pools. A lazy river and a cliff jump of 2 and 4m. Getting a seat was not hard. My highlight was the beach. Soft white sand and crystal clear water. The hotel has direct access and it was never busy compared to Karon Main Beach. The plunge pool was great after a warm day out on the town. It was cold but refreshing and comfortable within a few minutes. The kids loved dipping in even after their day at the swimming pool or beach swimming. The buffet breakfast was extensive but got a little repetitive after 6 days. We dined at the Cove twice (Thai) and the Italian restaurants once. The chefs were very accommodating with vegetarian options. Special thanks to Anan who always checked whether we were satsified with our dining options. The resort itself is about a 15-20 minute walk from central Karon or a 200 baht tuk tuk (expensive but worth it in the heat). Resort location was good for us being away from the busier areas. Overall a great stay and we would definitely consider coming back.",
            "We are very happy we booked at Centara Grand Beach in Phuket! Firstly - realize it will take about an hour to get to the resort from the airport. If you can book Phuket Best Tours before you go you will save money for there and back. The resort will charge you 1800 baht from the hotel. Best tours charged us 700! The hotel itself is spacious and quiet but only about 5-10 minute walk (on beach or road) to the busier Karon Beach town that has many restaurants, shops, massage shops, etc. You will find the restaurants much cheaper than at Centara Grand. Also even if you just go in to buy water it is worthwhile as the resort only gives you one complimentary bottle per day and any to buy are expensive. You can not drink the tap water. The breakfast buffet is varied and worth the price as not much else for choices. The food was good for breakfast and the other meals as well. The rooms were very clean, spacious and quiet. The pools were all lovely and you could always find a pool chair regardless of the time of day. The beach was at the far end so much quieter than when you got closer to Karon. You could easily walk over 30 minutes one direction! The water was warm, clear and the beach powdery sand. There were no other resorts in this area this close to the beach. All the staff were helpful and friendly. I have never been anywhere else that the staff went to far out of their way to be pleasant.",
            "We arrived here 4 days ago and so far so good! The location of the resort is breathtaking especially in the morning. The beach is always clean and eco friendly ( they pick up the trash on the beach and put it in the big fish container). Our favourite restaurant is the Cove restaurant whit their perfect buffets ( every night is different kind of buffet). The resort has a lot of different ways to have fun here from water slides, lazy river, tennis court, big gym and kids club. The Carpe Diem team is the highlight of this trip with their activities around the pool! Their pool games are so much fun and puts a smile to everyone face. Also they provide entrainment for adults with evening programs such as Trivia night and Latino night. They showed us basic salsa steps and that was awesome. We will recommend this resort to our friends and family.",
            "Spending 3 nights at the hotel is not enough. Hotel's facilities and staffs are so nice. Pool suite room - is the best choice for couple and solo traveler. The Cove restaurant - breakfast buffet is so awesome. There are many gluten free menu and so tasty. Dinner buffet is also interesting because chefs are so skillful. Especially for grilled menu. While the Mare restaurant that is located opposite the Cove provides an Italian cuisine and also romantic private dinner by the beach. Water park area is so excited. Long river cruise and waterfall point are so fun. There are large kid room in the hotel. So, parents don't need to worry about their kid. All area can be accessed by wheelchair. Tips : 1.) You don't need to call taxi to find any seafood restaurants in the city because the hotel provides you an awesome and tasty seafood menus with reasonable price (cheaper than in the city). 2.) You don't need to buy a trip to some islands because the hotel also provide you all facilities better than in the islands. 3.) Please buy a hotel money package such as Buy a THB10,000 you will get THB13,000 for all spending in the hotel. It's worth. Thank you Mr.Sid, Mr.Ray and teams from the restaurants for nice and warm welcome service.",
            "Everything about this hotel was great from the very helpful staff who took the time to contact our different touring companies to arrange for our pickup to the huge rooms with their incredible balconies. The beach at Centara matches any beach we've been to and is quiet. The breakfast buffet although it didn't have a lot of variety was delicious and the buffet staff were the best. The only sad point during our stay came as we were checking out, when I found a charge of 77Baht for a telephone call which I never made. Although the amount is less than 3 dollars and our combined bill was for thousands, the manager made a great deal out of it, going as far as trying to call the number to prove I was lying. I've never in my life made a call from any hotel I stayed at, besides why I should I do that when I have free roaming from my cell carrier...She finally made me feel like she was doing me a great favor by removing the charge. Again it's not about the money but the principle.",
            "Not worth it. The room we booked was Deluxe Spa Seaview (room 442), well yes the room itself inside is exactly as pictured, except for the seaview part. And that the balcony is kinda shared. There is a shared 'window/glass wall' that has wooden blinds that divides our balcony from another person's, so while you have your hot tub people can see through the crack in the 'wall', and not sure how the wooden blinds are locked. It's pretty uncomfortable. For the view, I look over the concrete top of one of the restaurants/fitness center/spa, and also a lot of the view is onto another room's corner balcony and it blocks the seaview. It is the furthest you can get away from the beach (it backs onto a mountain), so I can see some sea but I would not say it's a great view, especially for the price. Our room has little things like the makeup mirror is broken, and one pillowcase has what looks like a smudge of makeup and dried blood spots in it. They do a nice turn down service, and I guess they usually give a local fruit and we got a note about it with cutlery but no fruit. There was yelling and shouting coming from below my room, and I went to see what happened, and there was a staff member there with an extremely rude Australian family of 4 with children yelling and the (seemingly drunken) parents yelling obscenely and rudely at me when I asked him why this was happening. Staff did nothing. Not the resorts fault that people are rude, but people who have the luxury of travelling (especially to nice resorts) should be considerate of others. Now, I do believe it was the resort's fault not to do anything such as ask them to stop yelling and being rude or maybe even move my room. Prices are also way over-inflated here. Yes, Phuket is more expensive than other parts of Thailand because its so touristic, but a bottle of large water here is 230THB. I have been to various places in Thailand more than 6 times, including to Phuket previously. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this resort. There are many, just as nice places for much less, with friendly people and nice views you should go to instead.",
            "I travelled with my wife and 14yo son from Australia with many hurdles to jump (due to Covid) just to leave the country and get into Thailand. After PCR tests at the airport we were on our way to Centara Grand Beach Resort. My family were so looking forward to this holiday. My wife has had a real rough couple of years with medical issues so this was going to be the start of good things to come. However that was not to be as it started at check in where, although we had all the documentation that had our inclusions spelled out at the price we were to pay (Luxury Escape package with fine print that extra guest had to pay THB1700/night for all inclusions) the front reception tried to charge us an extra THB4000 on top per night for our son. I should mention that my wife has mobility issues and this was relayed to the hotel prior to arrival. We were buggied to our 1 bedroom villa (We paid extra to Luxury Escape for this) and couldnt believe it, we had to walk up 3 flights of stairs to a villa that was dirty, full of mold and stunk of it. We spent 2 nights in that room before they were able to move us (Note that the occupancy of the hotel at the time was only at about 40% full.) When we were moved I paid extra again for a 2 bedroom villa as it had smallest number of stairs and was close to the beach and amenities for my wife. Although we had paid extra we could not utilize the Club Lounge as it was closed, all restaurants had the exact same menu (so with an all inclusive dining package this was unsatisfying). The food was very average and on one occasion my son was served raw chicken. The location was great as its right on the beach and it pretty much services the hotel guests only although it is not a private beach. I was hoping to do some scuba diving as their website indicated they had a Padi Dive Centre on site but that hasn't been the case for about 6 years. The lazy river at time of our stay was under maintenance so the best part of it was closed. This hotel, although is marketed as a 5 star hotel I would only give it a 2 or 3 star based on Australian standards of hotels. Its run down, with our room furnishings broken, fans not working and TV reception not the best. The only positive I can give this resort is their SPA. The staff their were very professional and good at what they do. One of the best SPA's I have been to in Phuket. Breakfast buffet was not up to standard with hot meals being cold and food stale from dinner the night before. However the omelet station was good. If you are expecting a hotel of a 5 star quality with luxury inclusions, I would not recommend this place. We were bitterly disappointed as every other stay in Phuket we had prior (not at this hotel as this was our first stay) had been amazing.",
            "We were a party of 7 (4 Adults & 3 kids) who stayed at the Centara Grand Beach Resort & Spa Hotel for a week between 15th-22nd Feb 2020. We have had a truly wonderful experience from start to finish throughout the duration of our stay. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were all very polite, kind and courteous. Every request was accommodated promptly with a smile. We picked the resort as it seemed to be the most family friendly, we were not disappointed, whilst the hotel itself is a little dated and could do with a some refurbishment we had no complaints about the facilities, service, food and overall hospitality which were all 5 star. Upon Check in we were given a complimentary massage per room which was a wonderful touch. Both myself and sister agreed that It was by far the best message we had ever had and were amazed that we didnt have to pay a penny towards it. The breakfast at the hotel was fantastic, wide choice at the buffet and onsite oven from which freshly baked bread and pastries were served. Staff at the buffet couldnt have been more accommodating in terms of our vegetarian dietary requirements, they remembered my request for veggie Pad Thai on the first morning and thereafter asked for the next 6 days if I would like to have some Pad Thai every morning for breakfast. They even accommodated our requested for Indian masala Chai - nothing was too much trouble. The Hotel is ideally located within walking distance of Karon beach and a short 10 min ride into Patong which makes it the perfect location for those wanting to venture out and visit the local tourist hot spots. Overall a wonderful week spent at this hotel, would highly recommend especially for families with children.",
            "Stayed at the Centara grand for 2 nights with my mother to basically just super chill out and enjoy the beach location, also visit my cousin who works here as the executive sous chef. Upon arrival check-in was smoothly and swiftly done by a lovely lady called Namwaan. Thanks, top marks, very professional, welcoming, and pretty cute too. Due to room shortages for our selection of bed choice we recieved a complimentary upgrade which was greatly appreciated. Stunning beach-front location with top facilities and top class restaurants. Highly recommended. Keep up the good work, will be back again for sure!",
            "We stayed here as a family of 3 for 8 nights. The entertainment team; Sanja, Sara, Gino and David have been fab. Really welcoming and our son enjoyed their pool games. They make all guests feel welcome and are lovely to chat to. The jumping wall and water slides are whats kept our son busy for most of the holiday. The lifeguards at the top are great with all the kids. They knew our sons name after the first day and shouted lots of encouragement. He is now a great water bomber! You need to expect slow service at lunch when its busy. It took us a while to get used to this as didnt have this ever at the Katathani, our first hotel we always stay in. The hotel is really expensive for food and drink and there is nowhere on site to get snacks. Feels a rip off to be honest as other 5 star resorts do not charge these prices. We ate out each night due to this. The swimming pool needs urgent attention to stop guests injuring themselves. The tiles have cracked and some missing in several places. The steps are camouflaged and a trip hazzard. Quite shocking really. Overall we had a great time but sort the pool out and do more in the kids club for over 8s. Its pitiful as it is."

            "I'm glad I waited till the end of my trip to write this review as it started off perfect. Hotel location is great, two minutes down the driveway to the beach. Restaurants and shops along the street. Amazing food selection, meals double price of outside restaurants as expected of course. Hard working staff- came in to fix the soap dispenser and saw my towels on the floor, picked them up and replaced them which was not expected at all. Attention to detail, trimming plants and oiling wooden furniture on the roof top bar. Dedicated staff. However my last two days were not as impressive. Towels and toiletries were not replaced half way through the stay, the towels were stained and ripped, soap bottle still broken after two failed attempts to fix - just replace it. It was ceramic and heavy so when I unscrewed the pump to pour in to my hand I almost smashed my toe as it slipped in the shower. I asked twice that morning for a replacement and it wasn't untill I went to the reception area and told them face to face that it was a hazard and I almost lost a toe that someone finally did something about it. Meals at the restaurant were tasty but took 40minutes when there were only two other diners there. This was usual for both lunch and dinner times. My last dinner, they brought me a salmon pizza instead of chorizo. I picked up the salmon and tried it in front of the waitress and was certain it was seafood. I placed it back on the pizza and she served it to the table behind me when she realised my actual pizza was ready! Unbelievable. Some slip ups with quality of service towards the end of my trip but overall it is generally clean, great location, friendly staff and tasty food.",
            "Our family stayed here from 26.12.19 to 01.01.20. My room number was 2405 and was cleaned daily by Wan who was the most professional and friendly housekeep to date. Danny who had to deal with my initial complaint on arrival was very professional and extremely patient - thank you! The general manager too was ever so warm, helpful and approachable - his presence at the breakfast table was remarkable. Although I was quite ill for this trip, there was nothing you could not fault with the outstanding hospitality received during our stay at this hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel if you're staying in Karon. Attention to detail was prominent and the smallest touches i.e. drink vouchers, delivering things to our rooms even on New Year's Eve when all staff were extremely busy were not gone unnoticed. I would like to personally thank all the staff at this hotel for their hard work, efforts but most of all, each and everyone's hospitable graces. This has not been experienced before and I've travelled the world! Well done to the entire leadership and management team of this establishment as well as all staff. Best wishes A Bell",
            "Everything was amazing from the place to its service. When me and my girlfriend arrived in the hotel, it was late in the evening and there is this one receptionist named Aiko that served us in a very professional way. She gave us a welcome drink immediately and I was surprised that she also upgraded our room for our honeymoon which is really not though but I appreciate what she have done to us to make our stay there in the hotel memorable. She was very professional and very polite the way she tour us in every hotel establishments and facilities. She also escorted us to our room and explain every room amenities. Big thanks also to all room butler for making up our room daily and on time. But I'm not satisfied when it comes to changing our amenities in the room. After our errands for a whole day, even they make our room up, we always noticed that they still didn't change the whole set of our towels and also didn't change all of the bathroom amenities. I've been and I stayed in a 5 star hotel before and I think it is automatic to change the set of all towels and toilet amenities when making up a room. That was my only concern in the hotel and the rest was amazing. Every staff we've pass by greeted us in their local greetings and it makes us feel at home and respected to the highest level. I will never forget our stay in this hotel and I hope that next time we stay there again I will never encounter that problem again.",
            "We stayed at the Avista Grand last week. 90% of guests were Russian. Unfortunately alot of guests would hog the pool lounges by using their towels to reserve them and sometimes not using them until the afternoon. On our way to breakfast most lounges had towels and personal belongings already on them to reserve. Staff didn't do anything about it even though the signs say they will remove the towels if not used after 30 mins. Lots of kids but didn't bother us. Rooms were decent size, bathrooms large. We had mountain view room which had view of the Big Bhudda. Hotel not as big as it looks in the images. Only one pool but nice enough. Breakfast was nice, food at pool bar expensive. Hotel closer to Kata shops and restaurants than Karon main area. Cheap laundry just at the mini mart as you leave hotel, 50THB per kg. Lovely ladies doing massages and hair braids next to the mini mart at the Karon Community Massage. Overall it was a nice hotel but didn't like the rudeness of the Russians guests.",
            "We initially booked to stay here in 2020, but due to the pandemic had to delay our trip. The hotel couldnt of been more helpful in letting us rearrange. Hotel itself is beautiful and all areas are spotlessly clean. The staff are very welcoming and friendly and were at hand to assist with any enquiries. We were greeted by Sun on arrival and she showed us to our rooms and advised us about breakfast times and pool times etc. The pool is a lovely size and the beds are nice and comfortable. Towels are provided to use around the pool and beach. The breakfast buffet was very nice, freshly made coffees on request, fresh smoothies, an egg/ omelette station and a variety of European and Asian food. One of our family members had special dietary requirements and she was advised exactly what she could eat and made sure she was catered for. Our room looked out to the sea and had amazing sunset views. The room was very spacious for the 4 of us. The bathroom was a great size and I loved the way it had a privacy frosted glass cubicle for the toilet and shower, which meant that someone could shower whilst the toilet was being used. As a family of 4 this was great. The hotel itself is a 3 - 4 minute walk across to the beach over a main road, however there are pedestrian crossings and it isnt difficult to cross. You can hire 2 sun beds and a parasol for around 200 baht for the day. The beach is lovely and clean and the sea is very clear. Watch out for the waves though with younger children or older relatives as they are very strong and could cause them to be pulled under. Walking back to the hotel, the hotel is up a slight slope. This didnt cause us any problems but could see it could make people slightly out of breath if youre older. There is a golf buggy at the front and the front of house staff are always welcoming and ask if you want a lift down to the beach. Theres plenty of restaurants within a 10 minute walk. To the left is Kata and the right is Karon. Also a small shop just outside the hotel which sells cans of soft drinks / water & beer at a very reasonable price. Thank you Avista Grande, we cant wait to return.",
            "My wife and I just spent a week in Avista Grande Phuket Karon On our way back from Singapore and Australia. When we were shown to our 4th floor sea view deluxe room it was so stbunning that my wife was nealy in tears and I was not far off. What a beautiful hotel. Perfectly placed a ten minute walk slightly up hill in the south end of Karon Beach, an oasis of beauty. Staff were great, restaurant and breakfast lovely. Very hard to beat, couldn't get enough of the view and sunsets from the balcony. Can't really find any fault except I think there is a 30 minute rule about towels on pool beds which isn't policed as if you don't get your towel on a bed by about 9 am you won't get one. We often noticed towels on beds where people did not turn up until mid afternoon or a visit to the beach. Very unfair and should be adressed. Also the practice of hanging towels and clothind on balcony rails lowers the tone and overall effect of this beatifully designed hotel. A shame but would return there in a heartbeat despite this. The fact that Phuket needs some issues sorting regarding pollution etc is another story (paradise getting spoilt).",
            "We were celebrating our anniversary, and they gave us a complimentary upgrade. The room had a large, plush king-sized bed in the middle of the room, as well as a desk area (behind the head of the bed) and table with bench (at the foot of the bed). The room had a lovely bathroom with the shower having two shower heads and two rain showers from the ceiling. Everything about the room was just perfect! Because this was a corner room, we had not one but two balconies. The first overlooked the mountains and had two comfy mini couches and a coffee table. The second balcony had two lounge chairs and a jacuzzi tub for two! It was so romantic! The swimming pool was enormous, great for laps and included a pool bar where you could order food and drinks. The food we ordered there was brought to our lounge chair area. Everyone that worked here had a lovely disposition, very friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet costs 200 baht per person (which was a special deal), and it is worth every penny. Such variety and delicious food! We rented a motorcycle for the week to explore more of Phuket, and I recommend that to anyone who is traveling. But if you just wanted to stay at Avista Grande Phuket Karon- MGallery Hotel, without transportation, you could just stay there and eat at the restaurant. They have a billiards table and ping pong table in their rec room, which was fun. There is also a spa (if people want massages) and a workout room, which we did not use... but the equipment looks new and in good shape. This hotel is directly across the street from the beach. It was so easy to walk to the beach and ride the waves. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone! Such professional service, such kindness, and such excellence!",
            "This resort its just gorgeous and we loved every moment. The rooms are clean and lovely, we had super king size bed I liked how the shower and the toilet were divided with separate doors the rooms and bed was cleaned and changed daily at our request. Finally a hotel with a proper hair dryer, I find it so annoying when I go on holidays and the hair drying is a really poor quality, this time I went prepared with my own hair dryer to be surprised that the hair dryer in this hotel was a decent one. Pool was gorgeous I can only say that everything about this hotel is lovely, staff are really nice and friendly I would like to say a huge thank you to Toni who helped us with the madness of the second Covid test as part of the Test and Go program he made so many calls and spent so much time sorting this out for us as our previous hotel in Bangkok Arte Hotel hasnt done its job properly. We planned on staying from the 27th December up to the 2nd and ended up extending out stay up to the 4th of January 2022. We had breakfast included and it was a buffet which had a really good selection on food, food was really nice. I would definitely go back to this hotel and I encourage everyone if they plan to go Phuket its really close to the Karon beach pretty much 5 minutes walk there are a few restaurants around which you can have really nice local food if you are looking to try other local dishes and also pay less then at the hotel. Just impressed and amazed with the place and the quality of service they offer. Ive attached a few pictures.",
            "Avista grande is a nice resort in Phuket. It is in a very good location and close to restaurants and the beach. The pool area is the highlight of the resort. It is super relaxing. Staff are friendly but front desk can improve. Not as warm as other Thai hotels. Just be aware the beach view rooms have a very ugly view of a disused sports stadium. Main areas if feedback for management: Have a designated area for pool towels and return location. Towels are hidden at the back of the pool bar? Why? If you have a dedicated return area, people can clean up after themselves leaving the pool area cleaner. Take orders for eggs at the table with coffee. Chefs were forgetting peoples orders and was making the food area too hard to move around in. Breakfast in general is chaos. Would be nice to have a seperate area for platinum customers. Suite rooms have poor lighting in the bathrooms and needs to be improved. Who designed a hotel room with no side tables? Strange. Overall we had a nice week at the resort but I probably wouldnt go back.",
            "From the moment we arrived at the hotel, the staff were nothing but courteous and kind, and went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was going to be as good as it could possibly be. We had a deluxe suite with a sea view on the third floor of the hotel. The room was spacious, clean, and the design was very modern. Our room included the complimentary breakfast buffet which I highly recommend that you get as it is $25 per person otherwise. It is well worth paying a little bit extra to have included with your room, its much cheaper than paying for it separately. The buffet has anything you could want for breakfast including I'll make to order omelette bar which also includes a noodle section so you can have your choice of local Thai Noodle dishes made to order from the chef. They also have a station where they serve local cuisines which are all very good and give you a great insight to the wonderful food that Thailand has to offer. We saw way too many people (mainly American and European visitors) that would only get eggs and croissants and it seemed like such a waste to not take advantage of all the good local cuisine that the buffet has to offer. Don't be afraid to broaden your horizons, part of the experience of visiting Thailand is trying to local cuisine. The staff at this hotel are by far the most courteous, professional, and kind people that I've ever had the pleasure of meeting while traveling. They went above and beyond and out of their way to accommodate us. Anything they could do to help us be comfortable no matter how picky we might have been, always greeting us with a smile every time we saw them. The hotel is a 3 minute walk from the beach which is beautiful and and the water temperature is right around 85f all the time, all year long, everyday. I have to thank the staff again, as every single member of the staff that we encountered always greeted us with a smile and did whatever they could to make sure that we were happy while we were staying at the hotel. Whether it was the front desk receptionist, the servers at the restaurant, (the restaurant chef even went out of his way to personally make us a special Indian breakfast dish on our last day. The restaurant manager also made sure that he had breakfast ready for us to take with us in to-go boxes that we could take to the airport since our flight left at 2:30 a.m.) the bartender who tended to the pool side bar, or even the cleaning stuff they all went above and beyond to make sure that we were as comfortable as we could possibly be at any time. Thank you for a wonderful experience and it's definitely a vacation that we're never going to forget hopefully we'll be back sooner than later. Thank you to everyone there! Dennis And Hannah"

            "This was our 3rd stay here in the lovely Serene Wing. The rooms are very large and have a great view of the pool and also the hillside in the distance. It was good to see the improvements made in the room of white tiles on the bedroom floor and black and white pattern tiles on the bathroom floor. Lovely display of orchids on arrival in the room which was a nice touch. The staff in reception were excellent as always and the lovely man who helped with our cases. Breakfast has a good varied selection with juices and tea/coffee.",
            "We stayed from 26th December to 7th January in the Old Phuket room 2205. The rooms were very spacious clean and tidy. Shower was amazing hot and powerful. We had a bath but if strange place to set up a bath in the window, however you can pull the blinds. The breakfast was ok limited but what was on offer was delicious. The staff were very helpful and all very polite and welcoming. Our room was unfortunately not on the sunny side in the shade 24th so the hotel could have put us in a better sunnier room as it was not anywhere near half occupancy. The location is close to the beach and a few restaurants and a 10 walk on the front to Karon centre and a 15 min Tuk to either Patong or Kata beach. If u are an adventurer crab a moped 200 THB a day and go explore the beautiful surrounding areas well worth it. The beach is very clean and unspoilt quieter than the adjoining resorts. We were tested to death for covid but in all honesty it was so worth it to have 12 days of paradise. I would stay again and hopefully after covid restrictions see a fully open hotel as it is very bohemian and a little gem. We booked with Travelbag and flew with Qatar via Doha and was a seamless journey and only 40 mins in a taxi from the airport at 800 THB. The Thai residents are always friendly and cant do enough for you dont let a pandemic put you off visiting the country is finally opening its doors again and I will most definitely be returning this year.",
            "What can I say about the hotel except it lovely. For those that have never been to thailand the people are fantastic they will help you with anything you want. Please smile say sawadeeka and be polite. The food anywhere you want to eat is wonderful I would always recommend you try the street vendors for pad thai, average price about 70 baht. From the hotel walk up the seafront to the many bars our personal favourite is the Sutin bar, live music every evening free sambuca shots and the girls and yes ladyboys are very pleasant. Thailand is wonderful and you can see why so many people keep coming back.",
            "Lets just start out with the room our first room had a non working shower and and ac that dripped all over the place flooding our room. After we told them they said they would upgrade us so we got to the room and it was in no way an upgrade. Breakfast was not very good the same undercooked bacon everyday and toaster that burned the bread. And to top it off we were checking out and we didnt have all three of the room cards, PLASTIC ROOM CARDS, they wouldnt let us check out causing us to be late to the airport. I would not recommend this hotel.",
            "Has a fantastic two weeks at the old Phuket karon for the second time will defo be rebooking for a third time. We love this little hotel its a quite little oasis away from the bustle. Within a 5 mins walk to restaurants, shops, massage. This hotel has two pools serving bed and breakfast but lunch can be purchased ar the pool with lovely panoramic views Rooms cleaned daily with fresh towels and pool towels also daily which is lovely after a long hot day to have fresh towels. The staff at the hotel nothing is too much bother they go over and above and we will definitely book again for a third time.",
            "We stayed 12 nights in the Sino wing on the 2nd floor. We were very pleased with our stay and the staff at the hotel were very pleasant, friendly and helpful when required. The Sino wing is the oldest part of the resort and is in keeping with the character of Thailand, we loved it. The room was very clean and tidy with a decent balcony. The air conditioning could have been a bit better but it did nt spoil our trip. The pool on the 3rd floor is very nice and certainly quieter than the pool used by the visitors staying in the Serene wing. The beach is only a 2 minute walk from the hotel. The resort is right in the middle of Karon beach and very handy for the local points of interest and with plenty of places around for eating.",
            "I was disappointed when I arrived at the hotel. At first glance it looks like it will be beautiful. The grounds are well kept and the mountain backdrop and view of the big Buddha on the hills was amazing, however, the hotel is old needs some renovating and painting, the pool area looks depressing, tiles are coming off in the pool area and the decking is uneven and needs redoing. Moreover our room booking said we would be in a different wing but when we asked about it we were just told we had the correct room, the day we checked in someone entered our room with their own room key, at the same time the reception called our room to say they had given someone the wrong key. Possibly because she had given us the wrong room?!? The AC was noisy and couldnt be turned to a suitable setting. It was either blasting or we had to turn it off. We didnt make a fuss because we just wanted to get on with exploring Phuket. The first day I went to breakfast I grabbed a plate and went to pick up a piece of fruit, to be met by a swarm of fruit flies. There was a lot of food uncovered and it put me off. I didnt eat breakfast at the hotel because of that first morning, even though we paid for bed & breakfast. The first day there was a carrier bag filled with fish guts or something just dumped at the bottom of the stairs to the rooms. It was cleaned up eventually but it had been there a few hours. The staff were friendly enough and the location is perfect for exploring Phuket. The room was cleaned to a good standard. We are still scratching our heads how the reception knew we had drunk 2 Chang from the fridge on our very last nightunless they were planning on charging us for 2 we hadnt drunk. Guess well never know. We did have a great time in the end but that first day I felt like crying.",
            "We have just returned from 11 days at this Hotel and we loved it. It was our first time in Thailand and we will definitely return. Our room was on the 3rd floor in the Sino Wing with a Jacuzzi bath on the balcony, room was of a good size, very clean and tidy, plenty of storage, plenty of plug sockets, mini fridge and tea/coffee, bathroom was clean and had everything needed. The Staff at the Hotel are very nice and helpful and nothing was ever a problem. The Pool areas were clean and tidy and both had a bar serving drinks and food and at reasonable prices. We enjoyed Karon itself also, the beach was very nice, lots of little bars and restaurants in close proximity and very good value.",
            "Stayed in the older Sino Wing which had a lovely big room and great sea view. Amenities in the room although the mattress was a bit hard For location this hotel ticks a lot of boxes. Right next to a lovely beach with lots of bars/restaurants close by and good bus links to Phuket Town and other beaches The big let down is only 2 umbrellas across both pools. The pool in the sino wing had 10 sunbeds which is nowhere near enough. If you want a nice pool with shade this is not the hotel for you. . The beach is 200thb for 2 beds and a parasol Breakfast is also quite poor.not much choice for English guests and the pre cooked eggs all go cold. The vast majority of guests are Russian",
            "We were upgraded to a pool access room on arrival due to the hotel being quiet because of COVID. Room was beautiful, really spacious and we especially liked the bathroom. We got floating breakfast our first morning which we ate in the pool. There is a good variety of breakfast food. All staff were lovely and helpful, gave us recommendations of local hikes and places to visit. Would recommend walking down to the left to Kata for a bit of a livelier atmosphere, Karon itself wasnt lively enough for us. We got a 10 min taxi to Patong to go out there as well, taxis are easy to get. We didnt like the hotel restaurant at the end of the street as the food wasnt great at dinner. Other than that, couldnt fault the hotel."

            "We had a lovely time here. The staff are unfailingly helpful as a request for extra chairs and glasses showed but sometimes the service at meals is terribly slow. On our first day a request for milk for our coffee through room service took two hours and three phone calls to sort. We experienced a chaotic breakfast on one occasion (out of four). Dinner at The Plantation restaurant was tasty but oh so slow despite having ordered an hour in advance - it took a further hour once we were seated. At Firefly for dinner the service was slicker but our first two choices of wines from their list were not available which was a little embarrassing as we were hosting friends. Checkout was all over the place. We were incorrectly charged for items from the minibar which had been removed by staff as out of date and not replaced and an incorrect amount was put into the card machine which took five or six attempts to rectify! However, The room was spotless and super comfortable, the wifi excellent and we did really enjoy our stay it just feels as though service/training needs tightening up.",
            "From airport pick up, check-in to check out we enjoyed this hotel. It is a very well-maintained property, when you call for a buggy to pick you up from your room, it arrives quickly and sweeps you off to your location. The staff in Firefly the restaurant, 360 bar and Spa were all very well trained and meet you with that renowned Thai hospitality and smile. Nothing was too hard for them. The quality and variety of food at Firefly was very good, well done to Rey and his team. They even went out of their way to cook us Morning Glory everyday, even though it was not on the menu. The pool Spa Villa we booked, was very spacious and clean, just what you need for a fly and flop holiday. However, if you want a more active holiday, they can certainly arrange everything for you. They made our wedding anniversary very special with a few personal touches, which we apricated very much.",
            "Two of my girlfriends and I planned an EPIC trip to celebrate our milestone birthday for a total of 30 of our friends and family to stay at The Pavillions. I am so happy that we decided on this property. From the beginning, Rhatha from their team was very responsive to the numerous questions and asks that I had, over extending herself in some cases to ensure that our group was happy. Her and the ENTIRE team ensured that all of our needs were met prior to and during our stay. The pics on their website are exactly what the property looks like...peaceful, lush, private tropical paradise. We arranged, at an additional cost for transportation to pick us up from the airport and we were greeted with cold waters, cold rags to cool you down because it is really humid there and fresh fruit for our approximately 20-30mins from the airport. We were then greeted by the front desk team to get us checked in quickly and taken to our rooms via buggy. You are then given a tour of your room which I had the pleasure of having Rhatha do for me. I booked a Pavillion !! Our room was amazing, pool with a view, huge living room with tv, private room for our daily massages, which were amazing each day, huge room/walk-in closet and indoor and outdoor shower. We did not want to leave our room!! That villa did not miss any amenity. Our group chat once everyone was checked in blew up with everyones tremendous approval of the property and their rooms. You dont want to miss breakfast which is included had a wide variety of options and very tasty. The team at Firefly was amazing to us during our stay. You dont want to miss the sunset at 360 bar..you definitely need your bug spray but amazing view and tasty libations. You dont want to miss your daily massages..our masseuses hands were heavenly and released any stress from our days activities. Everyone from our group had only awesome things to say about their daily experiences, we definitely kept them busy with all the varied treatments that we booked because they were so good. All in all you CAN NOT go wrong with booking this property. I will definitely be back and this time will spend more time to enjoy the property and all of its amenities as while we were there for a week,i could have easily spent another 2-3 days before coming home.",
            "Our stay at The Pavilions Phuket was totally improvised since our original travel plans had to changed due to the Covid-19 travel bans for some nations. Thailand is always a welcoming part of the part and therefore we booked a plane from HK 30 min. before its departure and ultimately booked our hotel upon arrival at Phuket International Airport at midnight. Booking was very easy, and things got sorted out very nicely by night staff. As the name of the property suggests, a piece of mountain land has been turned into a small village with villas, and different functional pavilions (spa, bar restaurants, guest rooms ). The Buggy cart operated by reception staff is your best ally to move around the Hotel, unless you get your own transportation by renting a car or a scooter that would allow you to travel all over the island, saving you the hassle of taxi fee negotiation. Our room was large, tidy and clean with a small kitchen and two bathroom. To be honest, expect for few occasions, to have 2 showers might be a bit too much for a double room, especially when the hotel wants to alert its clientele on being eco-friendly. Having 2 toilets was thus sufficient to my point of view. The balcony was voluntary small in order to preserve some distance and intimacy from other rooms, still it was a bit too small for me, especially for those willing to cook and eat on the balcony. Breakfast is excellent and with extended operating hours. So is the gastronomic restaurant where service and atmosphere were both professional and serene. We couldnt enjoy massage at the spa due to booking lists and therapists availability, which surprised us since we had 4 days of stay rarely meeting other guests on hotel grounds. Overall, price/quality ratio was good. Distance to the beach is compensated by the silence of the mountain environment and hotel configuration which gave us another view of Phukets culture and life.",
            "Firstly may we thank The Pavillion for allowing us the opportunity to rebook our stay. Originally we had booked for April 2020 but due the pandemic the hotel had to close but they gave us the option to come back any time within a 12 month period. This was a humane thing to have done and was greatly appreciated by us. As expected all amenities were not open which is not a criticism since in no way was it detrimental to our stay. The staff that served us during breakfast and dinner were excellent. Nan, Pook and Goy went out of their way to ensure the service was friendly, attentive and prompt. Our thanks to these hard working people. Kudos also to Chef Ryan who produced a wonderful array of food during the festive season, many thanks to you all. Whilst the rooms are spacious they were certainly in the need of an upgrade and needed some TLC. Repairing chipped furniture and paintwork would not cost a lot of money and would enhance the property with little effort. Daily massage was carried out in our room and was to a high standard by qualified staff. Daily room cleaning was somewhat strange, normally this is done without request but we had to request this service ourselves. Maybe this is a consequence of the COVID issue. However no complaints about cleanliness throughout the resort, staff were very aware of COVID regulations and we felt safe during our stay. The resort is in the hillside and such is very steep to negotiate by foot. However a superb buggy service is at hand whenever you require to move around, the guys that run this service are promptly at hand to take you to your required location. In summary an excellent stay, friendly and accommodating staff, peaceful location and more than could have been expected due to this unwelcome virus. Wishing all at The Pavilions a happy and hopefully a prosperous New Year for 2021. Peter and Evonie",
            "Just spent 3 magical days at The Pavilions in Phuket. A lovely hilltop resort in the north of the island, away from all of the bust streets and party beaches. From the start we were really impressed with the room size, we stayed in a Garden Suite which was huge (over 95 sqm!) and there was plenty of space for our toddler to run around. We indulged poolside at Firefly restaurant which had great food and drink offerings at very reasonable prices plus they also offer a free shuttle down to the beach (literally 5 minutes) if you feel like a dip in the sea. Overall we were super impressed with the warm hospitality of all the staff, a very special place that I would highly recommend- we will definitely be back.",
            "Overall it is for us important to underline that the team is highly committed and motivated to provide the best service! Especially the people in charge of for the room service / in room dining have fulfilled all our wishes very professional with the necessary degree of sensibility and friendliness. An own BBQ at the villa is a fantastic experience! Thanks for that! Unluckily we discovered a couple of changes where we were a little bit disappointed (e. g. we asked to receive 2 pieces of bread for the Toaster now available in the room, which have been charged not that cheap!, we ordered a cheese board and got 1 very thin slice of cheese divided in 4 pieces also very expensive, the breakfast is not anymore available at The Plantation which is an unique experience in the morning and a good reason to be in this hotel, the room where we spent a renovation is required from our point of view, ...). We were invited to attend the Manager Cocktail. Thanks again! The only guy from the Management there was the Manager responsible for the housekeeping! BTW a very gentle person! At the Firefly I wanted to get a simple Steak with a salad! 2 runs at different days were necessary to be able to place my order! I had always the impression, if you want something extraordinary it is going to be difficult at the Firefly! The SPA is perfectly organized and the treatments are very good! The DJ at the 360 Bar is amazing! Finally, our conclusion is that we had overall a nice stay, but it was not comparable with the previous experiences we made before! We will continue to have an eye on The Pavilions to see what is going to happen in the future...",
            "A bit disappointed that we cannot book the seaview villa because of the age restriction but we are pretty happy with the pool villa, the overall structure and setup of the villa. The cleaning service has room to improve, we need to ask two times to clean the room at night and have to ask for more towel couple times as well. The spa experience is pleasant but I think the ambience can be improved with better lighting and music.",
            "The pavilion one bedroom villa is the way to stay if you want a comfortable luxurious and special stay. The complex is spotless and so quiet its peaceful. The staff are so accommodating and its the small touches such as the turn down service and daily house cleaning. The quality of the room ammenities makes you feel like you have constant access to a day spa. The drinks and food are clean, crips and a huge variety. Activities are limited but if you stay in a villa trust me you will be more then happy to relax there.",
            "My wife, daughter and I booked this resort through Luxury Escapes and paid $1800 each. We were then informed that we had to pay extra for an additional person in the room. We were informed by email it would cost an additional $75 per night. We arrived at the resort only to be informed it would cost an additional $150 per night being an extra $1200. For an extra $600 we could have brought another adult and my daughter would have had their own villa. Instead they turned the lounge into a bed. This was totally unacceptable as we could not watch TV and she is an adult who paid the same as we did. After negotiating we got a single bed put into the massage room. The hot water in the shower didnt work and even after paying the additional money the room was only set up for two people I.e. two towels etc The first day the power went out so no aircon. Taxi fares into Patong are $45 each way. We booked a tour and because you need to get around the resort in a golf buggy we booked one and waited 25 minutes for it. The people in the tour van were annoyed with us from the onset. So far not a great experience"

            "We stayed in Banyan Tree Phuket for 4 nights, and we absolutely loved the property! Upon our arrival, we were welcomed with bright smiles and the grand lobby. The cold and sweet welcome drink, along with the cold wet towel was definitely a great treat in the heat. Check-in was done quickly, and soon we were escorted to our Villa via buggy. We loved how spacious the Villa was! We stayed in the Signature 2 bedroom Villa, and there was more than enough space for the 4 of us to lounge around. Thankfully we had a private pool in the Villa, and we could swim anytime cause we were unfortunately there during the monsoon season. The floats provided by the team did perked up our stay a little! We loved the breakfast spread and variety daily! There was also complimentary spa massage during the breakfast session, that was definitely the highlight of the stay! We also loved how there were complimentary bikes on the resort and we could explore the resort via bikes! We also participated in the resort activities - yoga and activities during our stay. It was definitely a great way to unwind during our holiday. Thank you to the concierge team for buggy-ing us around the resort 24/7! Definitely isnt an easy feat but they are always so ready on call. Special mention to Kik, the security guard who always welcomed us at the lobby! He was always so welcoming, and knew our Villa number after our second day. He was always anticipating our needs - whether we needed our car or buggy, he was always ready to help! Thank you for delighting our stay Kik, hes definitely a true gem in Banyan Tree Phuket. Would definitely love to be back when the weathers a bit better, and to fully experience and explore the entire property! 10/10 will recommend! I love to stay around the Bang Tao/Laguna area as there arent many tourists, and there are always so many food and massages nearby!",
            "My partner and I spent about 4 days at the resort and had a fantastic time...everything was absolutely perfect from checkin to checkout. Reception, welcome, service, staff, quality of the amenities, food, location are all top of the top in every respect. Things we have loved: the rooms are massive and didnt have any issues with mosquitos as I feared being so close to the Laguna, loved the decoration with amazing wood and luxurious products. Couple of minutes walk to an amazing beach, or if you prefer to can cycle as bikes are available for you to use to go everywhere. The hotel will provide you with towels, a little cooler with some wet face towels and water. Amazing. You can enjoy a nice happy hour cocktail at the bar and they will bring really nice nibbles. Food at the restaurant is very good but if you prefer to go to the cheaper options into town they will arrange reservation to their recommended places which I also recommend if you spend more than a couple of days there. They will also arrange for the taxi. The breakfast is absolutely amazing with so much choices and if you like you can have it next to the lake with a wonderful panorama and tranquility. I want to mention here that we have been looked at by one of the most wonderful and helpful staff that we ever had travelling, her name is Bee and if you ever have the chance to go and meet with her, she will do everything she can to make your stay the best and easiest of all, with always a smile on her face and the best intention of all. If it was not for our desire to always discover new places, I would come back to the Banyan every possible time we could. Thank you Banyan Tree Phuket.",
            "My favorite Hotel in Phuket! The Banyan Tree Phuket on Layan beach.I stayed in the the Luxury Serenity Pool Villa. This stunning villa boasts a beautiful and supremely comfortable bedroom including a17.5 sq/m private swimming pool & whirlpool surrounded by peaceful greenery. Inside the Luxury Serenity Pool Villa is huge king size bed and sofa couch. A large bathroom and separate walk-in closet, and 2 wash basins. The bathroom connects directly to the swimming pool which is super convenient. You can call the hotel's free shuttle car to take you to from the main entrance across the street to Layan beach. The Beach is so beautiful, relaxing and clean. The Banyan Tree Phuket is also close to a Family Mart and only 5 mins drive sees you at the supermarketat Boat avenue if you wish to stock up on snacks and drinks. The breakfast at the banyan Tree Phuket is great and includes amazing Thai food! You can nosh on many choices including fresh bakery, an egg station, fresh fruit juices, and yummy noodles. The entire breakfast is fresh and tasty. The hotel includes sparkling wine for breakfast just like the Banyan Tree in Bangkok. You can also have a Floating breakfast in your room! There are 2 choices (Western and Asian Set menu) The Floating breakfast is served right to the front of your Villa! We had the Western set menu (2,220 THB) in the pool it's so chill when you have breakfast in your private pool while soaking up the relaxing ambiance. The Western set includes croissants, salad, cold cuts, smoked salmon, eggs, mixed fruits and yogurt. Everything is delicious! An amazing start to your day! For dinner, we recommended you to try a new experience. Lepetit cinematic dining experience, featuring 3D cinema you can enjoy along with your scrumptious food right at your table. They have 2 packages Gold and Platinum. Contact the hotel for details and availability. Guests can expect world famous Thai service at the Banyan Tree Phuket!",
            "Had a ten night stay at Banyan Tree Phuket and whilst we had a wonderful holiday, there were a few causes for complaint. Firstly the grounds are beautiful and the staff are so friendly and helpful, it would be hard to not completely relax during any stay there. The standard pool villas are nice but its worth looking at Grand Lagoon Villa or above for more space, a larger pool and more privacy. You should expect to see a lot of kids at this resort so if youd rather have more quiet meal times etc then Id advise looking at another resort. The rooms we stopped in were both nice but could both do with freshening up. Both rooms would benefit from some new technology/entertainment options. One room had a very comfortable mattress but the next room we had to ask for a new mattress as it was so old it was virtually folding on itself. Food was very mixed, Breakfast each day was wonderful, lunches were good but evening meals were problematic as two of the restaurants were very poor (Tre and Watercourt) and two were average (Saffron and Taihei). We had to complain a few times about the quality of our dishes. I think the resort should completely reinvent their restaurants with new menus and a new approach to their dining offering. Sometimes you have to accept that you cant get high quality food whilst on holiday, but we had one meal at a resort close by that was stunning so its a shame that Banyan Tree dont seem to make the same effort with their cuisine given the cost of the meals etc. Drinks are also very expensive unless you make use of the happy hours. Quality of the cocktails was poor and the bar was usually empty after 20:00. Youll read a lot of great reviews and some poor ones and the truth is probably somewhere in between. The resort is great, the staff are fantastic but a few things stop it from being a truly 5 star destination.",
            "Ok I travel a lot globally, like every four weeks and generally stay in five star plus or luxury places. Only stating this to give some perspective of my opinion. Pros Very clean and well kempt gardens and landscape Spacious resort Peaceful Swift service by frontline staff The beach bar cafe had excellent service by a man whose name I forget but he has worked there for 12 years. Nice little gifts every evening on bed Free bicycles to ride around the resort a very nice touch. Cons Very expensive for dining. Even compared to London, New York, San Francisco etc. Prices just a bit too high. And this is comparing to other Phuket five star places as well. I see other reviews state this too. We cant all be wrong. The spa was extortionate. More expensive than anywhere Ive ever stayed. And I dont usually care but a massage for example was approx two or three times the price of a five star hotel. The in room dining desserts need much improvement -not what I expect for a five star place I ordered different ones but none of them were very good. They did deduct them from my final bill to be fair. I was promised an upgrade on arrival according to my booking if available. I was advised none available. I stayed there a week and had asked on arrival if a non corner pool villa become available to contact me because there were a lot of people I could hear in my garden when they walked past as it was on a main route. I heard nothing yet on looking at reviews here several people who booked in just after me were offered upgrades. Sort of felt once I had booked in I was forgotten about. I stayed in a one bedroom pool villa which was a bit dated looking. It was very clean but interior needs updating. Pool itself was cleaned daily and well. Breakfast was fairly good but lacked daily variety especially with Thai food. The Indian selection did not taste great the aloo parathas need improving I think they use premixed powdered potatoes. Not bad and beautiful views and really friendly staff generally the service in Thailand is great anyway and this was not out of the norm. Would I stay here again? Probably not in terms of value for money unless there was an incentive to book again which is a shame because I come to Thailand frequently",
            "Our first time in Phuket! We chose banyan tree based on location (away from Patong) and an exclusive property. Everything was perfect (especially our second room) first was much older in style, second was newer, but the new serenity suites are the type we should have requested! Staff are amazing from check in to buggy drivers.. super friendly and attentive! They were always happy to help. General Manager is extremely friendly and approachable, he makes an effort to roam amongst guests (havent experienced this before) A very special mention to James who checked us in and really defined the meaning of customer service and attentiveness.. our kids ages 2&4 are still asking where he is! He definitely left an impression. We will be back!",
            "Staying here was a homage to our first visit to Phuket in 1997 when we had a fantastic holiday at what was the Laguna Beach Club probably a 3 or 4 star facility and discovered the wonder of the 5 star ambience and restaurant in the Banyan Tree. At the time charming little boats and shuttle buses ran around the lagoon transporting you between the hotels in the Laguna complex and our relatively unsophisticated selves were enchanted with the whole place. Realistically we knew that the hotel would be older and of course the COVID-19 situation would mean compromises. Therefore, I am trying to review with a myriad of buts, qualifications and historical expectations. The rates for the room are incredible and so value for money is amazing. If we were paying rack rate Id feel very short changed. The hotel is tired. It is over 25 years old and feels it. There are the usual small things in an older place like not enough power points in the right places but also scratched glass surfaces and just a generally needs attention feel. They also have a plinth round the bed destined to decimate unwary guests legs in the dark which is a very nineties / noughties feature. The facilities like the shuttle boats, restaurants, pool bars etc. are very restricted so the experience is not the full one hence the price is fair. The slurping of drains from next doors pool maybe is something that needs attended to. The service and staff are first class. Particular mention to the customer services lady on *0* who had a smile in her voice and was the best ever on guest services. Everything asked for came to the room speedily (or as speedily as the vast estate allows). On that point the real estate is gorgeous beautiful trees and space between villas. Amazing wildlife kingfishers, cranes, monitor lizards and the usual bird suspects. There is a small road between the hotel and the beach which is unspoiled (particularly now) and tranquil. The Japanese restaurant on site was lovely but we were the only guests in the night we went so going outside was our preference for the next two nights of our stay. Breakfast did not work. Three times in a row to be brought bacon when I have ordered scrambled eggs on toast is a bit unforgiveable particularly as I am vegetarian. The breadbasket was uninspired and nothing was great. The space was always full which when the estate had only 15 rooms occupied seemed unnecessary. Coffee excellent. The proximity to Boat Avenue is helpful giving a choice of shopping and alternative restaurants. Excellent stay. Very relaxing. At the current price would highly recommend.",
            "Had a lovely stay during 3 days. The staff is super helpful, dedicated and genuinely nice, always prompt in assisting you with a buggy ride, a coffee delivery or anything else. The room was surprisingly big (family pool villa) and although the resort has been there for quite a while, you definitely don't feel it in the villa. Nicely appointed, spacious, clean and modern with a large pool at the center. The resort area is huge and perfectly maintained, it feels very natural and peaceful walking around. We were quite impressed with the level of care the maintained the property especially in these trying times. Breakfast is plentiful with a wide variety of western and asian options. We never had the chance to stay in the Laguna Phuket area but when we do, we'll definitely be back here.",
            "This was our first stay at a Banyan Tree and are currently on our last day here. On arrival we were impressed with the check in and loved our grand two bedroom villa. All the staff are friendly, a shout out to John who approached us when we arrived and looked lost and proceeded to show us round. The villa is lovely and spacious and has a lovely size pool and jacuzzi. What makes this hotel is the staff and service, the buggy service is brilliant and always received a good greeting at breakfast and from security throughout the day and evening. There are nice touches like the little gifts left on the bed and the incense burners in the villa. Unfortunately I do have to mention some negatives, for a 5 star luxury resort we were not impressed with the dinner/ drinks here at all. On our first night we went to Le Petit Chef, this was an experience but unfortunately the food was not of the standard it needed to be at for the price. The Chinese noodle course we could not eat it was bland, tasteless and the duck was chewy and horrible. The menu showed this should of been lobster instead of duck too. Felt the food was a total rip off. We then ate at the Watercourt restaurant, this was very disappointing for the price and service was poor. We didnt receive a pudding but was charged for it. This put us off eating in the hotel for the rest of our stay and is no surprise why the hotel bar and restaurants seem so dead in the evenings. If the food was of excellent quality we would have liked to have dinner in the hotel more. Felt the food was extortionately priced and we had much better quality food outside the resort for less than half the price. We ordered some lunch inside the villa one day and that was not great either and again far over priced for what it was. Other negatives were when we arrived in the pool villa we found the speakers in the main bedroom were not working and the lights in the jacuzzi were not working either. To be fair they did replace the speaker fairly quickly but the jacuzzi was drained and took nearly all day to be fixed. This I feel should have been checked and would not expect in such a luxury resort. We unfortunately did have quite a problem with mosquitoes inside our villa which was a-shame especially as we have been in Thailand two weeks staying in two other places one an island and we didnt get bitten at all. The last negative was that my husband by our villa was hit twice once in the face by a Gardner strimming, with children around this could have been quite dangerous. We mentioned this to management which in turn did receive a bottle of sparkling wine which is a nice guesture but a little on the tight side compared to at our last 4* hotel we had an issue with one of the rooms air con and they gave us a complimentary meal for 5 at the hotel which we didnt expect at all. We have also noticed that we had other peoples meal and drinks added to our bill in error. It is just a little disappointing that we have stayed at three places for this holiday and the Banyan Tree was the most luxurious but have had the most problems. All in all we do love this hotel especially the pool villa but are left a little disappointed with some of the aspects mentioned.",
            "Arriving at the Banyan Tree Phuket, we were greeted by the bellhops, and our luggage was taken, tagged and set aside, whilst we were shown into the lobby and seated. A welcome drink was served while the staff from the check-in counter proceeded to retrieve and register us. We were later shifted from the lobby area into the Library on their own accord as the smell from the re-lacquering of the bar area was drifting over due to the breeze blowing through the lobby. Prior to arrival I had chosen to upgrade from a Serenity Pool Villa to a Signature Pool Villa and did not regret it. The villa I was given was close to the beach entrance of the property and on the opposite side of the lagoon away from the main building. My main issue about the villa was that it was starting to show its age. So the drain cover stones along the side of the pool were cracked, and the umbrella that was supposed to cover the sun lounger next to the pool was missing, which meant that it was generally unusable due to the intensity of the sun, though thankfully there was the sala just above the pool. Service by the staff was attentive when we got their attention, however, it was clear during my stay, that they were facing a staffing crunch as a result of the pandemic. But despite this all, the staff did their best to see to the needs of the guests. Bicycles were available for all guests, though the bicycles were also showing their age. That being said, do remember to pick one up, unless you are keen on walking as the property is huge. Whilst you could call the lobby to send a buggy over to pick you up, bear in mind that there are a lot of villas and there are only so many buggies on the property. So to be fair, if you end up waiting for 1/2 an hour for your buggy to arrive and send you to breakfast, it's really your own fault. If you are going to the beach it is nice to not have to worry about carrying water and/or a towel along with you. Banyan Tree has thotfully set up a station by the side gate with towels and bottles of water for you. There is also an area on the beach that has been set aside for guests of the Banyan Tree. Overall it was a fantastic stay, my partner and I spent most of our time in the villa. Only having gone out of the resort once. The only thing that marred the stay, through no fault of the staff were the Karens and their ill disciplined children screaming their heads off and disturbing the other guests."

            "Perfect stay ! Everything was perfect the kids had their own room (communicating by a classic door without accs to corridors for them wich is good) in both room theres separated, two bathroom, air conditioning system also wich is a plus as we dont enjoy the same temperature, tv, sofa for kids and even a PlayStation in their room, the rooms are really spacious with balcony but for our room we just need to open the door of the terrasse and we are at their beautiful swimming pool straight away wich is an extra comfort when you have to kids who love water Smoker friendly at some areas. The hotel is really really pretty the staff if very good and friendly. Happy hour drinks are possible to get, its especially enjoyable when you can sit at the bar inside of the swimming pool to enjoy it and keep an eye on the kids at the same time, even if we stay long in water it doesnt matter as the water is daily around 30 degree! We all even play in water under the rain as it really doesnt matter when you in the water and its warm weather. I laugh a lot with Wit my son liked him a lot even if he didnt understand the language Breakfast is really big, theres a lot of food for all the different taste it goes from soup, rice, cooked meal upon request included and of course the continental breakfast, its just huge and its really difficult to dont find something whos not to our taste as theres such a big variety. Its just over expectations! I definitely didnt want to leave! All the shops are close by, plenty street full of shops and some street only with bars, you can find anything you want and you even have the beach situated maximum at 5 minutes walk distance. What can we ask more?? We will come back again without any hesitation for our next trip In Thailand. Ive been searching for a negative side but didnt manage ! Theres even a place where If needed some babysitters take care of the kids. Its just perfect !!",
            "We were here during Christmas week and had a great time here. The service here was generally excellent, and the rooms were very clean and beautiful. The swimming pool was large and was able to accommodate even a large number of guests comfortably. There were numerous activities for guests and children (some with $5-$10 USD surcharges). The hotel was conveniently located, with a short walk to the beach, Bangla Road, and the Jungceylon mall. There are many shops and restaurants around the hotel. The morning breakfast was pretty well done - in fact, we find that the food served for lunch or dinner was inferior to the breakfast food.",
            "We spent our honeymoon there and had the best experince ever. The staff members are very friendly, helpful and hospitable. The service is amazing including the spa and food provided. We also booked our tours around phuket city and different islands through the hotel and all the trips were perfect with a very affordable price. Special thanks to Eaindra, who was the first one we met there. She's very friendly and cheerful. I would definetly recommend the hotel.",
            "The hotel location is very near by the beach and also the shopping mall center its very easy we can go by walk. Room is clean. Very nice service Thank for Faiicand Allanand delicious food! If I have a chat next time I will book pool access room",
            "I stayed at this hotel for 5 days and I would not recommend it. No early check in available, my room wasnt cleaned and when I asked the reception, they sent cleaners to my room at 4pm, which was weird. I wanted to borrow a nail clipper, the front desk couldnt understand me, when I tried to explain, I could feel that they got bored, when I said maybe a scissor,they just sent me to 7-11. Dont try their massage on the 1st floor, its over priced and really not good. The thing bothers me the most was their Wifi, its really unstable. And last thing was their taxi service, I got a taxi from Phuket airport to the hotel for 800, and they charged me 990 from hotel to airport.",
            "An absolute gem of a hotel! We arrived quite late in the night and the lady on reception (think her name was Fon) was so so lovely, welcome drink was really nice and Fon explained everything to us really well. We had booked a standard room but were upgraded to a deluxe and the room was really nice, large and it had a big tub as well as a shower. The location was brilliant, right in the middle of Patong main street with massage places, shops and laundry places right outside. Breakfast was so nice if not a little busy sometimes, large variety. We used the spa which was amazing, I went once alone and once for the mummy and me package. Toy was so good with my 3 year old daughter. Their welcome and after massage drinks are really nice. The hotel itself is decorated so nicely, the reception area is large and airy with great decor and the pool area is heavenly and the pool itself is so huge! It could do with a little more sun beds but was not too bad. They had a foam party at the kids pool twice in the week which our daughter loved. They also had a small playground near the pool We used the restaurant for dinner once and the staff were amazing at accommodating our requests for vegetarian options. The food was delicious too! Only one or two issues we came across was once or twice we requested the room to be cleaned but it took them a while, we had gone out and come back and it was still not cleaned. Same with a request for an extra towel which never appeared. Lastly we had some issues initially as we booked through booking.com where it had stated that they offered free shuttle from the airport. However when we messaged them they stated there was a charge. We messaged back showing them the screenshots but they said it was an error which they had amended and instead suggested that they can offer a free cancellation. However, we decided to stick with them as the hotel itself seemed great for kids and paid for the shuttles as it wasnt a huge cost. We were glad we had not cancelled as overall it was a lovely hotel and somewhere we would go again! Staff were so friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this one for the area, the food, the friendliness and the room itself was comfortable. Oh and the mango sticky rice in room service was oh so yummy!",
            "We were a tad concerned when our tour company booked our stay in Phuket at the Novotel. We had stayed in Novotels in Cairo, London and other cities and we have been very disappointed from the get go. This hotel was amazing. It exceeded our expectations. The room was clean, comfortable, very good view, partly garden and ocean. It was very spacious. The hotel has incredible views and beautiful gardens and 3 pools. The Wi-Fi is fast with no interruptions. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because the buffet food restaurant offered a limited arranged of food choice, not much fresh fruit and on most days of our stay the hot food wss actually cold. We wanted to check out late because we had a late flight but couldn't because the hotel was fully booked but they allowed us to keep our luggage in the lobby and let us used the facilities until it was time to go yo the airport. Their cleaning personnel is very honest. We had forgotten some personal articles in the bathroom and room they packed it for us and looked for us to return them. We were not aware we had left anything.",
            "We stayed at the Novotel Vintage Park from the 10th until 20th February. This hotel is absolutely amazing, and I certainly recommend it if you have a family. We were in a group of 18 people, and we had rooms all over the resort, however my recommendations with kids is get a family room! My kids are older so they were okay to walk around the resort by themselves however with smaller kids the family rooms at the pool was so handy. Thats where we all pretty much spent all of our time at the resort. Location was amazing for our 18-year-old children because they could easily walk to Bangla Road or get a Tuk Tuk. Swim up bar was relaxing. The staff were very helpful. On the second last day, we tried the restaurant and I really wish we had of tried the restaurant beforehand because the food was amazing. We had breakfast included with our package, which we all did you get over the breakfast options as they didnt change too much day to day. I definitely recommend Novotel Vintage Park!",
            "On our 5th visit to Phuket, we picked this hotel primarily due to it's proximity to all the main attractions in Patong. We stayed for 7 nights in a pool access room, and it was a great choice. The hotel staff have a way of putting a smile on your face. Our visit was in March 2020, right when the COVID crisis was breaking out in the world, and the hotel took ample precautions with abundance of hand sanitizers and other measures throughout the property. We had daily breakfast in the restaurant which was a decent buffet with a good mix of Western and Asian options. We were warmly greeted by the Novotel trainee from Spain (Oriol) every morning. The hotel also offers complementary fitness classes. We enjoyed doing the daily Aqua Aerobics in the pool with our trainer Ding Ding Mark. Both him, and another hotel employee (Abel) went above and beyond in making our stay fun and warm. The hotel is walking distance to the beach and local restaurants and attractions including the Bangla Walking street. We will certainly return and stay here on our next visit to Phuket. A special shout out to the staff - Abel, Ding Ding, Oriol, and many others!",
            "Stayed at Novotel Phuket Vintage Park from 13 to 17 Oct. Booked the airport transfer and had a pleasant ride with the driver Chai, who was friendly and helpful with our luggage. Was amazed by the cultural interior of the hotel design. Check in was fast and prompt. Friendly front desk service crew ushered us to our room at level 5. That made us feel even welcomed. Room cleanliness was good. However, the hotel did not provide amenities such as toothbrush and razor. Do remember to bring yours if you are staying here. Also, the stove from the kitchen was near our room. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to consider changing. (We are at 5515). Poor room soundproof is also one improvement the hotel can look into. We were wakened by our next door neighbour almost every night around 5am. Thankfully when we contacted the operator, she was helpful in assisting us by calling our noisy neighbor to keep it down. Breakfast at Novotel Vintage was so so. You may want to consider the cafe nearby instead, which taste better. Though the hotel offers average hotel amenities and food, I must compliment the well-trained service crews who had offered wonderful services during our stay. Kudos to driver Chai, front desk lady who bring us up to our room, friendly crew from The Square (including the chef at the egg station), the front desk receptionist who assisted us in cleaning our wet corridor after the rain and also prompting us to rearrange the timing of our airport transfer in case of flood, lastly, the bellhop who lent us umbrellas for the rain. They had gone to an extra mile to level up our staying experience, which is indeed commendable."

            "We were visiting Thailand for the first time for our honeymoon. After a long 17 hour flight from Uk to Phuket we finally made it to our amazing hotel Paradox and then I tell you it lived up over our expectations. When we first got to our hotel we were overwhelmed with how gorgeous the lobby is. So modern & traditional at the same time with a lot of seating areas. We were greeted by welcome drinks and the most amazing smelling refreshing wet towel to clean our hands and face. We waited for our room for about 1 hour as we arrived early but in that time we got to explore the hotel. When our room was ready the staff took our bags up and welcomed us into the room. The room was so clean and modern feel to it. I loved the bathroom and the shower was huge. I appreciated the lighting in the room a lot as if we didnt want to have all of the lights on they had modern strip lighting in the bathroom under the sink and under the bedside tables which made the room feel really cosy. We had a room with a balcony in which we had a sea view, it was breathtaking! We also had a very big Tv in the room which was good if we just wanted to cool off and relax before going out in the evening. Me and my husband were amazed at how clean the staff kept the hotel and grounds. Paradox has made a walk through area which you can walk through to get you straight into the beach which was honestly amazing as we felt we could go to the beach or come back whenever wanted to without having to get a tuk tuk. From our room on the 5th floor to the beach was about a 6-8 minute walk (depending on how fast you walk). The pool area was also very nice, super chilled vibe. The location of the hotel was very good as we could just walk to have dinner in the evenings and have a few drinks at the local bars. We stayed at the Paradox for 10 nights and we would honestly recommend it to anyone. One of the best hotels right next to Karon Beach. DEFINITELY would come to visit Paradox again.",
            "If you are looking for a quiet beach pretty much like a private beach this hotel is for you. We absolute LOVE the room and service and the view, they just reopen their hotel a month ago so its going to quiet all around the hotel but breakfast is open room service is running with very limited menu the bar is open until 10 pm The staff were very attentive very nice very polite and friendly , the male bartender Ann was great but the bar menu were limited too I highly recommend to reserve a room residential type 2 bed 2 bath it really worth the money and the view from our balcony is beautiful just like in a picture, 2 pool is open spa is open with special price. PS theres nothing really open outside the hotel except 7-11 if you are looking for seafood meal you have to drive to rawai beach",
            "Cannot find fault with our 11 night stay, everything was perfect, if anything the fridge in our Villa could have been colder. Excellent location, beautiful swim beach across the road, plenty of nice restaurants, some shops and massage salons. The staff at Movenpick are wonderful, so friendly and helpful, breakfast at the resort was good and the rooms were very clean. We stayed in a Penthouse Plung Pool Villa which was very spacious with a roof top terrace and Plung pool. The resort had beautiful well kept gardens and swimming pools. The resort is a little expensive as is the icecream and the resort restaurants are more expensive than eating out but that is usually the case with all resorts.",
            "We booked our stay a few hours before our arrival Despite the fact that we booked at the last minute, we paid the flexible rate (modification and possible cancellation) because we never know if we will like the place and we never know how long we will stay there. This is our way of discovering a country and travelling. We arrived at the hotel early in the afternoon, handed our passports, went to our room and returned to the reception half an hour later. I do not wish to criticize the infrastructure of the hotel, but it simply did not suit us. There were too many people to our liking, one on top of the other, and it was not at all what we wanted. After explaining our request to the (charming) receptionist, she did everything she could to help us and went to find the manager. A \"Manager\" who didn't even bother to come and simply demanded a payment of 400 euros as compensation (I remind you that we stayed for half an hour and that we had a flexible rate with cancellation). We then landed in another hotel, where we were able to measure the difference ( manager present, attentive to your requests, not a cattle park) ... It's the first time that this happens to us in Thailand, where we travel regularly.... and it happened with a chain supposed to be \"famous\" like the Movenpick !!! Our freedom may have cost us 400e, but I don't regret to have left because it says a lot about the respect of the customers . As for the staff, they were adorable and deserve much better than working for such a group. Roussel M",
            "Every few months I like to spend a few days by the sea, so I decided to go down to Phuket. This hotel is on Karon Beach, though I usually stay on or near Kata Beach, which I prefer, I decided to give it a try. Of course I realize that the resort was shut for months and that it just recently reopened, and I could easily see that the whole Southwestern area of Phuket was a ghost town. Places like this must be bleeding cash. However, this is a part of a large chain of hotels and resorts, and there is no better time to do renovations than when the place is deserted. I saw no evidence of work. My room was ok, nothing special. Dogeared is how I would describe it. Unfortunately, I don't seem to be able to upload the pictures I took of the work that was needed to be done to the room. I didn't bother to eat at the resort, though my room included breakfast, as the menu they provided me was a standard \"American breakfast\" concoction, and I don't eat that type of food. Besides, there was delicious local food available nearby. I would not stay here again, both because of the location, the condition of the resort and the basically useless \"complementary\" wifi.",
            "For the price you pay, compared to the other resorts around, Paradox is actually pretty good. The location was great, the rooms spacious and clean. The resort itself its beautiful and so so green! so many trees and foliage, and the resort is HUGE. The staff is also very nice, their command of English is not the best, but they try really hard and are very attentive. The pool never felt crowded and we always managed to find a sunbed on either pool. One of the things i REALLY appreciated about Paradox is that we booked ahead of the holidays and closer to our stay i noticed that the room price dropped drastically, i contacted the hotel since i booked direct and they upgraded my stay to a pool villa. Their manager and front desk were amazing in honoring the rate we paid. Now the not so great. The toiletries in the hotel are very cheap, which i think it can be changed so easily. All beach towels were a bit old, same with the furnishings of the hotel and in the room. Some of the rooms are being renovated so this might change in the near future. Breakfast can def be improved, we were there 5 days and it was the same and the selection not large enough, very very basic. Another issue we had is that we booked an airport pick up and we had to wait for the car for 40 min after we landed which was annoying to wait around. All in all it was a wonderful stay with some hiccups but the staff and the grounds of the hotel are so nice and beautiful that it supersedes the bad.",
            "We recently spent 8 nights at Paradox resort Karon beach for our honeymoon. The resort was beautiful with excellent amenities and the staff were lovely and always greeted us with a smile and a hello, there was even one man who drove his cart past our villa and backed up to make sure he said hello which we found wonderful! Our villa was a wonderful size and very well appointed with a comfortable bed, indoor and outdoor shower and bathtub, just across the path from the spa where were both enjoyed a lovely massage and within 200m of the beach and close to the outside eateries and shops. Room service was easily accessible via an app in your phone and the food on offer from the restaurant for breakfast lunch and dinner was delicious. The pools were lovely and well maintained. I loved the resident cat, Millie I think her name was, she was just beautiful. The only downside was the rudeness of some of the Russian guests. All in all, Id definitely love to come back again and recommend this resort to couples and families alike.",
            "Stayed in a plunge pool villa in 2019, just coming around to review it. The location of the room was good, offering easy access to the beach road and wasn't too far from the main restaurant either. The room layout and furnishings were good, bed was comfortable. But there were a few negatives - The room had a strong musty smell, and soon we realised it was because of the air conditioning. Not acceptable from any hotel chain. The breakfast area was always too busy, we had to struggle to find a table most of the time (we are early risers, not the last minute ones). Towards the end of the stay we didn't bother, just headed out to eat better food in peace!",
            "Paradox Resort is quite good but certainly not as per its marketing material. We were only informed that it is in the transition phase to its new owner on arrival. The very large foyer is not overly welcoming, dated, dreary and devoid of people. Fortunately the lady who checked us in was warm & welcoming and showed us to our room. The room was faultless, comfortable, well appointed, contemporary in design with a balcony and sea views, as booked. The pool is well maintained with a swim up bar which incidentally is the only bar open during the day (closes ant 7pm) and only place from which to procure lunch. The food was average at best (generally arrived cold) and its restaurant on the beach front which opens in the evening was not a great deal better. This hotel has massive potential with a variety of accommodation offerings in its vast wooded environment. At this point, it lacks atmosphere and facilities particularly with regards bar and dining. Its saving grace is its ever helpful and friendly staff.",
            "We went to the main restaurant Pacifica for breakfast and lunch and Mint restaurant for dinner daily. Service was attentive and there was a willingness to help out with additional food requests due to illness, not related to resort. Waiter, Peth in particular at Pacifica deserves credit for his caring response and constancy in checking that we were ok. It's this aspect that is redeeming about this well cared for older resort. Food selection for westerns was restricted, requests were met. Mint restaurant food was ok service mostly good. Wali restaurant near Mint restaurant in Karon Square was excellent with good fresh healthy food and engaging owner. Room servicing was excellent and constant with regular supply of bottled water, which was needed in humid, hot conditions outside. Aircon greatly appreciated in these conditions. Excellent deep pool with lifeguard outside Garden Villa"

            "It was my fourth trip to Phuket, but I was a little nervous because it was my first time in southern Phuket. But that worry quickly turned out to be a useless worry. I mean, this hotel is that great. As expected, I will finish this review simply with advantages and disadvantages. Strengths - The price! The price! The price! The price is really good. You'll know what I mean when you come into your room. I don't think there's a hotel like this in Phuket at this price. If you value cost-effectiveness a lot, I recommend you stay here. - If you get a room Pool Villa side , you can see the vast ocean view south of Phuket. - Breakfast is also very good!(This is a good tip. If you ask the staff at the breakfast restaurant separately, you can eat fresh mangoes on a plate.) - This hotel has a private beach and you can enjoy various water sports. - The programs run by the hotel are very fruitful and good. - Outside the resort, there are massage shops, laundry services, and reasonably priced restaurants. There is also a taxi service, but everyone uses Grab or Bolt these days, so just refer to it. - Almost all the staff at the hotel in Phuket are friendly, but I think the staff here were even more friendly. They always greeted me with a smile first and looked for any problems. I was very moved and thankful to see them like that. Especially, an employee named Best helped my family a lot. Thank you so much. Weakness - Sad news for someone who likes snorkeling. I'm not sure because I can't go deeper, but I couldn't find the point where the fish are. In addition, the difference between the tides is huge here, so you have to catch the timing when the seawater comes in. When I stayed at this hotel, it was windy and the view underwater was blurry and bad. I heard there is another beach near this hotel, but I haven't tried it. I'll try it on my next visit to Phuket. - The convenience store right outside the hotel is gone. - Grabfood or foodpanda are available, but the hotel is quite a long distance from the delivery area, so delivery costs are high and it takes some time. That's it. You can think of the rest as advantages. Of course I'll stay here next time I visit Phuket. I think three nights will be enough. Thank you so much, Pullman Panwa Beach Resort!!",
            "Absolutely beautiful reception area. Very clean and spacious. Very warm welcome with cold flannels and drink given on arrival. 3000 baht deposit in cash or 4000 deposit if via credit card. Bags taken to our room quickly and we were shown directly to our room by a lovely friendly member of staff. We had a pool view room with balcony. Lovely size room with dressing table area, separate toilet and bathroom. Coffee and tea making facilities and complimentary water each day. The house cleaners were very late cleaning the room each day and the one day we had to call and request them to come with fresh towels etc! The pools are beautiful and there are plenty of activities throughout the day by the pool free of charge; as well as kayaking and paddle boarding. Towels were being left on sun beds and the staff were not monitoring this even though it states no reserving of sun beds! This should be stopped as there are staff at the pool all day therefore obvious that people are leaving their things to save the beds until later! Whole hotel very clean. Breakfast had the vastest choice of different foods/fruit that I have ever seen. The area the hotel is in is very secluded with the beach, a few nearby restaurants and bars and that is it. It is a place you would come to chill out for around 3-4 days as there is no real night life. We booked this hotel knowing this and were very pleased. I must recommend the bar One Love. The ladies are extremely friendly and the food is fantastic and plenty of it. I would also recommend Ben Panwa, even though the food is more expensive, as the staff are lovely. The other bar we liked is the Small Bar, a quirky bar but lovely lady who runs it. The hotel also has a free shuttle bus once a day that takes you to Phuket Shopping Centre. It is beautiful but expensive! I would class this hotel as a 4 star not 5 star mainly due to the room facilities and maid service.",
            "This is not a 5 star, but a very good 4 in my opinion. The service and staff are excellent. The breakfast buffet is plentiful and varied, pretty much had everything except muesli ( which I love ) The pools are lovely. The area is very quiet with not a lot to do, which is exactly what we wanted. My negative feedback sounds trivial, but needs to be said. Our room was not cleaned as well as it could have been, for example coffee cups werent washed properly, there were no pillow protectors ( just pillowcase over a stained pillow), towels were hit and miss ( sometimes we had just 2 bath towels but nothing else, although once we pointed it out on each occasion it was sorted ) The room just didnt look inviting. The staff are amazing, especially at breakfast. The music at breakfast could be improved, maybe playing some relaxing Thai music. SUNBEDS........ due to many reserving their beds and disappearing for hours, the hotel asked guests to only put towels down when you are using the beds and not to leave for more than an hour, or else they will remove your things. This was a good idea, as we lost our first day because we couldnt get a sunbed. The solution.... more sunbeds ! All in all a good holiday, but not outstanding.",
            "PLEASE, PLEASE read this review before booking a stay here! The resort is on the south east corner of the island of Phuket. The Pullman Phuket Panwa resort is advertised as a 'beach' resort, this is not the case. The beach at high tide is 100 feet wide and 15 feet deep. At low tide a large area of sand and patches of seaweed is revealed. Before venturing into the water at high tide or walking onto the sand at low tide, you need to be aware of the debris that is on the far left side of the beach, behind some bushes (photos below) that presumably comes in on the tide. There is also a smell of sewage and fish on the beach. The hotel is ajacent to a deep sea port which may account for the rubbish. We did not venture into the sea or walk on the sand at low tide as did not believe it was hygenic to do so. We took a taxi each day for a return cost of 35 to Phukets' west coast where the best beaches are. There was a sombre air amongst the other guests - mainly european, russian and a few chinese maybe because they also felt dissappointed, seduced by the Pullman Panwas promo photos and drone videos. The room we stayed in was 'travelodge' in styling, no thai influence at all. There are 3 swimming pools. A film of presumably suncream can be seen on the water. There are no obvious signs advising guests to shower before entering. Some tiles are chipped / cracked and some of the grouting has turned green from algae. The resort has a 'tired' feel to it and needs a refurbishment. The two star rating we have given is for the wonderful thai staff - all the waiters / waitresses and front desk team and for the amazing buffet breakfast, as good as we have ever had. If we knew what we now know, we would not have stayed on this corner of Phuket and not at this hotel.",
            "We travel to Thailand three to four times a year and we stay with family in the area of Panwa. For Christmas Day this year we decided to book to take our grand children to Pullman Panwa for Christmas Buffet Lunch. On arrival at the Pullman and taken to the outside area near the pool and beach I noticed the entire Buffet Lunch was out in full sun, there was no refrigeration for the seafood or any of the food for that matter. When shown to our table it was about 50 metres away from the buffet in an area that we were not happy with, stairs everywhere, you needed to be a mountain goat to get to the buffet. I looked at it and decided that my family were not going to eat any of this food and asked could we eat in the restaurant a la carte. The room is dark and dingey, had no Christmas Spirit about it, only 6 other people dining, it took the waitress 15 minutes to bring the menu, which was well worn, long overdue for reprint, then20 minutes later we managed to find someone, after my husband went hunting for a waiter/waitress we managed to order drinks, then 30 minutes later we were still waiting. We just got up and left. On reaching the car I called Sri Panwa and they managed to fit us in and we had the best of days, not leaving there until 8pm that night. Pullman Panwa is a disgrace to the Pullman name, never every again will we visit this hotel.",
            "We stayed 10 nights during the 2019 Year End break. The hotel is spacious, the rooms are comfy and offer modern utilities including air conditioning (but no mosquito shields). The staff is friendly and useful but can be overwhelmed at busy times. We've had to wait over an hour for food at lunch time for instance. It's ok, we were on vacation but keep that in mind if you're in a hurry. The restaurant/cafe across the street slightly to the left is a very good alternative (at a 1/3 of the price). Back to the hotel: the location is secluded meaning you're away from Phuket's crowds. You can rent a taxi directly from the hotel or across the street, or rent a scooter 500 meters to the left of the hotel (toward the aquarium) for a ridiculously low price. If you're looking for a quiet place, you found it. Nice pools, direct beach access, free kayaks and boards, happy hour at the bars twice a day. Excellent choice at the breakfast buffet, and restaurants are really good.",
            "Took a trip with family for my 40th Birthday expecting to have a nice private pool with Ocean View experience. Accor booking website mistakenly write wrong room's name type and detail for Pool Villa. They both 2 types of Pool Villa clearly states the location of the rooms to have the view of the Andaman Ocean. But in reality only the room with the highest price has the ocean view while the other only has garden view. We booked 3 rooms (1 with the highest price and 2 with the second highest price) We also has Gold Accor member thinking we might be upgraded to the next higher room type anyway. But in reality at check-in, the hotel told us that the rooms we booked were 1 Villa with Ocean and 2 Villa with Garden which is a totally different story from what is mentioned on their own website. The people at front desk took pictures of our confirmed booking which clearly stated the Ocean type room and admitting their mistake in the website but stated that the room with Ocean views are all full which we will have to stay at the Garden view for the other 2 rooms. We insisted we should be getting the rooms with Ocean view that we booked for. After a few hours they eventually gave us all room with Ocean view. Not sure what went behind the backstage since they initally said the room with Ocean are all full. Maybe they kickedout some guests to give us those rooms or the rooms weren't actually full in the first place?",
            "Wow what a wonderful place to stay at we had 10 great days here the staff from the cleaners to the management are all very friendly nothing is to much trouble but to be honest we had nothing to complain about the food was delicous beautiful presented every morning so much choice. i have a serious bowel disease & i managed to eat every day. Yoga was so much fun special mention to the guys Wut & Elm fingers crossed i have spelt your names right ? William Daguin you are a gentleman & in this day & age that is a rareity next time I visit we will be doing some yoga together thank you for the room on our return on my husbands Birthday Chocolate Cake! towels were made to look like a cake well done to our maid also the lovely petals scattered on the bed a beautiful touch.

Plenty of sun beds & lots beach towels we never had to ask for one the staff are good at looking & seeing who needs what. I really cant wait to come back if i could award you 11 starts i would well done The Pullmans Panwa Beach hotel >",
            "Such a pleasant, most relaxing 'mini getaway' for our tiny family of 3! We traveled to Phuket simply to celebrate our all in one BDays and anniversary. Pullman Panwa is our first try and possibly the best so far, judging by the genuine service - 'connected from the heart'received & felt from all staff throughout the facility. Many thanks to K. Ann (for a lovely welcome card & dessert prep.), our Welcomer whom i forgot to asked for her name, breakfast servers/attendants K. Dada, K. Kate and more... we got to know a couple of exclusive locations for many breathtaking photo just by following the directions/insights the F&B staff gave us. Recreation Activities were also amazing (we tried Supboard & Kayaking), they took hundreds of photo and video just for you, super accommodating since you know, some time all you need is just that one nice shot ;) OH and the croissant!! they taste real good..Light, buttery & fluffy, the way we love. One important note though, if you are staying at the Pool Villa, try not to leave any unattended food/empty plates outside the balcony, that is if you don't want a friendly visit from a local lizard, lol.",
            "We stayed there for the weekend at the beginning of April. The customer service is great, and the place is pretty beautiful. However, their customer service could be improved quite a bit. There were a few occasions where they had completely forgotten about things we had ordered. I think the resort may be somewhat understaffed in the evening and need to hire more people. Communication between the guest and employees sometimes gets lost and you will find yourself reminding the front desk of the conversations you had. The restaurant by the pool that serves western food was like eating at a 7-11, I recommended to the staff that they change the menu as the prices for the food don't reflect the quality. The breakfast and Thai food was excellent. Foil surfing lacked helmets in small and in XL, therefor it was a no-go. The upper deck shallow pond/pools where there are beds to relax out doors should be cleaned, and the jets in the pools should be fixed as they are no longer functioning. I believe for the price, breakfast and transportation from the airport should be included. Overall, it was a nice resort, the thai employees were very easy to get along with. I can't comment on the spa, as we didn't use the spa. But the resort seems to need a bit of maintenance and menu changes."

            "Visited this hotel in Feb/March 2023 with my husband, son (19) and daughter (13). We stayed in family connecting rooms and were here for 16 nights. Firstly the hotel is beautiful, looks very grand and defo worth its 5*. Our rooms were clean, spacious and had everything we could need. Our room overlooked the pool and was on the first floor. The beds/pillows were very comfortable and the air conditioning was perfect. The housekeeping staff were brilliant and always had our room spotless with fresh bedding and towels. We had more than enough space to put our clothes away. The hotel was in an ideal spot, close to the beach and restaurants, with Bangla Rd about 10-15 min walk away. Pool was fantastic with plenty of sun loungers, never had an issue getting one. It was quite shaded though so if you are a sun worshipper you might need to move your bed about, coming from Scotland we like it as we dont see very much of it. We had breakfast included, staff always found us a table so no queuing like some European hotels. The food was very nice and we always had a lovely breakfast, even my picky eater son. The kitchen closed at 10am but they didn't rush you out, just stopped making food at the live stations. On check out day we used the spa for showers and kept our going home clothes in the lockers in changing rooms. Always rate hotels on whether I would return or recommend them. On this occasion we would defo do both. We loved our time at the Grand Mercure, this is due to the wonderful staff (everyone), the food, cleanliness and location. Thank you for a wonderful family holiday.",
            "In the past, weve experienced troubles regarding our hotel experiences, particularly in The Meritus Pelangi Beach Resort and Spa Langkawi Malaysia. However, this was definitely not the case for the Grand Mercure in Phuket Thailand. Upon arrival to this resort we were comfortably greeted by Duty manager Bond. Bond went above and beyond for myself and my family on multiple occasions throughout our stay and treated us as if we had been continuous guests at the hotel for years. We were greeted with complimentary drinks and towels upon arrival. He provided us with multiple suggestions for visits in Phuket and the hotel staff were incredible. They showed us around the hotel and all its amenities whilst making us feel comfortable and at home. The hotel itself was amazing. It is located in a great area where markets, stores and food are all commonplace. The pricing of foods at the hotel was fair the breakfast buffet included a variety of options that never left u wanting for more. The hotel staff were always helpful and eager to take part in conversation. Upon arrival the front desk staff were excellent in allowing us into our rooms early and not having to wait for a certain time to refresh after a long day of traveling. The hotel also provided us with complimentary breakfast baskets as we had an early flight and wouldnt be present for the hotels breakfast that morning which was extremely appreciated. The main and only let down was the high tea. The food, dessert and drinks provided remained the same each day and a variety was never present. Overall, I will definitely be returning to this hotel in future when returning to Phuket. The Duty Manager Bond, the hotel staff and the hotel in itself made our stay enjoyable and provided us with great memories to take onto our future endeavors.",
            "This hotel is a very nice hotel. The first time we checked in we entered the building to a very beautiful sight and a yummy beverage with some nice fresh towels upon check in. Laii checked us in she was detailed and helpful. Very nice and to the point. We stayed for a bit more than a week and we had such a good time. Bond and Sixtine really impressed us with their hard work, helpfulness, enthusiasm and all around professionalism. Bond upon check in was so enthusiastic to let us know where to go and what to do and that really made us excited in turn. Sixtine was hard working, precise and just a doll all around. They both deserve a raise and recognition for people like them are what help promote and keep the hotel at a good reputation amungst many other things that are necessary.. like cleanliness. The cleaning lady for our room was sweet and she did her part in making the room feel fresh and clean everytime we had our room cleaned. This is a really good hotel that comes with a good deal and offers a 5 star experience. The spa was really nice for their massages and facials. Most of them were very sweet and accomodating. Not too forget and definitely extremely impressed by the breakfast that was literally more than breakfast. It was like all around anything you could ever think of or want for breakfast kind of breakfast with some lunch items included in as well. Everything was sooo yummmy and fresh. Bravo to the chefs. And nice job to everyone who works hard everyday to keep the hotel running. Thank you guys for a good first experience in Thailand. We will be back.",
            "For location the hotel cannot be beaten its close enough to all the mightlife and beach in Patong with an area opposite that has the usual bars and stalls selling goods and some street food units. The hotel itself is tired and the bedroom and bathroom whilst on the service appreared clean when you looked deeper neither were. The room size is adequate and was OK for a 5 day stay but does lack storage space and we only had 2 hangers.. The pool area is very small and lacks sunbed space and if you didnt get down early then you struggled to find one and had to sit at the poolside tables. Service here was almost not existent until 1600 when Happy hour started. They also start setting up the restaurant buffet around 1600 whcih is by the pool and we were often made to feel we were in the way while they did this. We ate in the restaurant one night and the service was very good, the food was OK. The service in the lobby bar was also lacking with staff more interested in chatting with each other. Also lacks litle extras like nuts/snacks with drinks which you get across the road when you pay 80baht for a beer !!. The reception staff were very plesant.",
            "We stayed in the hotel for three nights. The rooms are clean and hygienic, but routine business hotel types. The hotel is located centrally in patong and you can visit most of the happening places in few minutes. However, there are few things which are on the downside. Firstly, in a happening place like patong, one expects service level to be good and some guidance from the staff to tourists on the city. Instead, my experience was that nobody was interested in talking to the guests. Secondly, for the amount of money which one is paying, one expects something more than a routine business hotel. Felt there are better options in phuket for same amount of money. Lastly, if you are from India, the hotel has no option for Indian food at all. Every time one has to walk out of the hotel for food. The good part is, there are some options nearby so you would not have to struggle a lot. However, if you are an Indian and staying, do not pick breakfast as a part of the package, as you would not have anything apart from bread, butter and juice which would be able to consume. Overall, from my side, not recommended.",
            "I recently stayed one week at the Grand Mercure in Phuket and I really enjoyed my stay there. Everything about the hotel is absolutely first class from the room and pool to the breakfast buffet in the morning but what is really special about the hotel is the professional and helpful staff. Everyone working there, from the maids to the receptionists and bellmen, do everything they can to make your stay a memorable one; you are definitely treated like a VIP by everyone. I stayed in a pool access room and the room had every amenity, the wifi connection was great and there was a HDMI wall connection for viewing programs from your laptop to the TV in the room. The breakfast buffet had fresh coffee and eggs made to order and a selection of many fruits, pastries, and Thai dishes for breakfast that was amazing. The location is also excellent with Patong Beach and many restaurants within easy walking distance. This is one hotel that checks all of the right boxes.",
            "The Grand Mercure Phuket Patong has a peaceful setting around the pool and inviting lounge/reception area. The pool swim-up rooms are particularly nice as you can laze on your private deck and just slide into the pool. The breakfast/dining area around the pool is very relaxing, the food is very good and the staff particularly friendly. The hotel is 10 minute walk to the beach and nightlife. I would certainly stay at the Grand Mercure again on my next visit.",
            "Beautiful hotel in a great location. Rooms are modern and clean. Breakfast was also great and what I appreciated was all the halal food items there were clear signs and the restaurant manager confirmed with me they dont cross contaminate. This hotel dropped stars for me is because on the first day of checking in one of the staff member accused me of lying. I had booked 2 twin rooms for 4 adults and the hotel was super busy and I dont think they realised that they had over booked or something. So their was a guy and a lady checking us in the lady checking us in the lady was friendly the guy was so frustrated and rude. I had told him I had booked two twins hes like no you didnt you booked king and that theyre fully booked etc and I shouldve booked the right room. Then when I went on my app on booking.com and it clearly showed 2 rooms with twin beds he just went quiet not even an apology then he got 2 twin rooms for us. So it wasnt that hard to do then why be so difficult about it and why accuse me of lying. I really didnt appreciate this from that front of house staff. Other than him other staff were friendly here",
            "We are staying here and got 2 days left of our stay. Dara and Sar are great staff. Hotel is def not a five star but a great 4 star. I have stayed at other mercure hotels and some are hit and miss. We were not disappointed with the pool entry room its small but very clean and convenient plus the terrace is big enough for loungers and tbh we spent most of our time dipping in the pool and enjoying our terrace so really only used the room to sleep. Think TV could improve only one movie channel in English perhaps a Hindi movie channel?. We used the spa and that was good but v pricey at 11000 baht and felt a bit rushed. But there are really good options just near the hotel that are v convenient and clean. We are loving our stay because its relaxing but I think we have stayed at more welcoming resorts in Thailand even Phuket and where you get a bit more for the money you pay. The location is excellent 5 mins to the beach and minutes from lovely restaurants and shopping. Breakfast is good with Asian and European choices. Great halal choices too. Ate at Bubbles one evening food was good and not unreasonable in price. But there are restaurants galore within five minutes walk the hotel is very well located. Would recommend but dont expect 5 star its an amazing hotel nonetheless",
            "I travel a lot in the world, especially in Asia I have been attending this hotel for several years. It is perfectly maintained and the benefits are largely at the height of what you can expect from an institution of this level. The staff is always present, effective, discreet and capable of meeting all your expectations. A special mention for its director who is always available for his clients. The rooms are large, clean and very comfortable. Very close to Patong Beach, but enjoying an exceptional calm. The huge pool only adds to the pleasure of stay. The breakfast is exceptional. Delicious restaurants offer a varied choice of Asian and European cuisines. If you want a very good hotel with excellent value for money you can come there without hesitation. Certainly one of the best choices to do in Phuket."

            "What a wonderful hotel! We have had the most marvellous and unforgettable stay at the Pullman Phuket Arcadia Naithon Beach. From the moment we arrived at the airport in Phuket we were greeted at the entrance by the vivacious and brilliant Syn, who with Chad the driver, brought us to the hotel. This was such a convenient and easy choice for us, after two months traveling in Europe. On arrival at reception, our registration for our three night stay was seamless having done much of the online registration earlier. As we were being taken through the offerings of the hotel and made welcome by Mae Mae, the hotel loyalty manager, we were also welcomed by Albert, the excellent and proactive manager of the Pullman Arcadia. We cant remember a hotel manager being so engaged and interested in his guests as Albert and met with him on other occasions during our stay. We felt very very welcome and appreciated. We dined on our first night at the excellent Italian inspired Vero restaurant and on our other nights at Elements, the all day dining restaurant, offering an excellent breakfast buffet and impressive evening dining combining western and Asian menus. They catered brilliantly for my wifes gluten intolerance. Nothing was too much trouble. Thank you to Urs, the Food Manager, who visited our table to check that we had all we needed and to make our stay as comfortable as possible when dining. Thank you also to the wonderful staff who cared for us during our stay and to Khaw who was such a great ambassador for the hotel when she engaged so cheerfully at breakfast. The entire team at the hotel were outstanding. The entire Elements restaurant team are the kindest and most accommodating! They are such lovely people. Pong and Orn who managed the breakfast and dinner team whilst we there were unbelievably caring especially of Elizabeth and her gluten intolerance! Thank you Pong, Orn, Miw, Kha, Note, Aom, Sonya, Pupay and Chadon. We will be back. The hotel spreads over several levels all accessible by foot or buggy should one be needed. We had an ocean view room which was wonderful and a real treat during our stay. The room itself was perfect with an excellent bed and efficient air conditioning. There was nothing we could fault about our stay and will definitely be return visitors should another opportunity arise when we are able to travel to Thailand. Thank you to Albert and his wonderful team for their care and kindness during our stay!",
            "We stayed at the Pullman Arcadia for 8 nights and had a great time! Right from the check in, we were greeted with smiling faces and a lot of info about the resort. Our rooms were located far up the hill but had nice views and was very quiet. The buggy/pick up service was fast although our room was a quick downhill walk to the restaurants and lobby area. Only gripe is the aircon was not strong enough to kill the humidity and the floors became very wet and slippery. We came on an all-inclusive package. Breakfast could be improved in terms of variety, the same things were offered everyday and after the 4th morning the novelty had died. The lunch menu at the restaurant and pool bar is quite limited but was delicious! But the best part was the dinners that were offered. Of the 8 nights, we managed to have 2 buffets at the Italian restaurant which included freshly cooked meats and fish, one seafood buffet which was to die for and one Thai-themed buffet which was average, although the local Thai flavors didn't feel authentic which is a shame. The service here is really outstanding! Everyday we saw the GM - Brett, walking around greeting everyone and chatting. And Roxanna, head of operations was always friendly and made a point to say hello and check in whenever we saw her. What really impressed me was her and her team's effort in cleaning up the beach for the guests even though it is a public beach. The restaurant managers were also always very attentive and welcoming and made it a point to engage and provide good service. The beach is a step downhill walk (which means a step uphill walk back up) but the water is warm and shallow and there is a huge area for building sand castles with the kids. A stroll down the beach will also bring you along to some stalls selling fresh fruit and souvenirs. The kids clubs offered a shelf of books, small ball pit, Xbox, wii console and two computers which didn't really do much. This was probably more appropriate for kids above 7. You had to pay 400 baht for each activity, and with three kids we ended up paying a lot to keep them entertained. For the little ones the fish feeding at 5pm was also a highlight. The care gives in the kids club are also worth a mention, always patient and caring and made the kids feel at home. The gym was adequate and well stocked, and not usually crowded and offered personal training sessions at a cost. The spa treatments were average, probably not worth their cost If you had to pay, but our package came with some freebies. Overall a great resort with a nice atmosphere and really impressive service.",
            "Firstly, we must say that the staff at this hotel are world class, nothing is too much trouble and everything is done with a big smile. We stayed here for five nights as part of a multi stop Thai holiday. We stayed about 6 years ago and regretfully, it wasnt as good as before. We booked a grand sea view room which was nice. However, because both pools were crammed with very few available sun beds, large noisy groups and screaming poorly behaved unsupervised children, we had to move at considerable expense, to a pool villa. The villa had its own huge pool which was lovely, the villa was stunning, with doors on each side, opening to an unbroken view of the Andamanda Sea and breathtaking sunsets. Breakfast was often like a bun fight due to the volume of people. We found the breakfast was just OK., the pastries were stale every day. The resort is built on an extremely steep site so getting a lift from road level or reception level is necessary. The biggest disappointment was that Naithon beach area closes at 9pm or so, after which time, there is absolutely nothing happening. Previously, it was a vibrant little beach area but now, the beach has been cleared of bars and eateries with a few permanent buildings across the road, we found the atmosphere was quite dead. Overall and very sadly, we wouldnt return.",
            "On our final night at the Pullman while feeling disappointed that we were leaving the next day I said to me wife: We are on the other side of the world but this feels like home. Im not sure you can pay a bigger compliment to a hotel. As most reviews say, the rooms are fab, the atmosphere is relaxed, the scenery is beautiful, the food is great and the service is simply amazing. But so I dont repeat all that I want other travellers to know about the little things that turn a good stay into a great stay. Theres the manager Brett who introduced himself with a genuinely warm smile at Thursday night cocktails, and the operations manager who personally made an effort to say hi and thanks at breakfast after my wife wrote a nice review of her time at the spa the day before. Theres Mook (sorry if I got your name wrong) who was so friendly every night when arranging cars back to our room, who helped us with Thai pronunciation and told us (without us prompting any of the following) about complementary Thursday cocktails, and who offered to arrange a late checkout on our final day. There was the hand sanitiser everywhere, the ice cold infused complimentary water by the pool, the button to press at the pool for service so you dont have to move, the gluten free bread and pancakes specially made for my wife without fuss, the powerful rain shower, the separate closet for your clothes, the meticulously clean gym, the nice scent in communal areas, the excellent air con, the padded sun loungers, and best of all, the warm smiles from all the staff. I could go on... I think this is very clearly a very well run hotel given the staff seem to be engaged and things run like clockwork, which is a great sign, and should minimise issues for other travellers. There are many lovely hotels around the world with 5-star facilities but its the little things that often make the big difference and the Pullman has both the 5-star facilities but also gets the extra touches spot on.",
            "My wife and I visited the Pullman resort for two weeks in Feb 2020. The resort is a very nice place to stay with friendly staff and a couple of nice restaurants and bar on-site mostly overlooking the beautiful bay and town below. The resort has everything you could want if you were happy to stay on-site for the duration of your holidays, such as pools (x2) bars (x3), a Gym, Spa and nice restaurants. The beach is a few minutes walk from the main reception or the same from reception via one of the buggy transfers. The town below has a number of eateries (all pretty basic Thai food) but limited places to drink, and I note that everything is mainly closed by 10:30 pm. Again noting the above the location is a sleepy part of Phuket and you will need to get in a taxi to find a nice place to eat or some nightlife (such as Pan Tong). Taxis are not that cheap however with a turn around to Phuket town or Pan Tong being ~50. I would definitely recommend this as a location for couples looking to get away for a quiet couple of weeks. This is a family resort however and there were a number of young children in the pool having a good time during our sleepy days which did sometimes make it a bit noisy. In terms of guests, I would say that it was ~20% UK residents followed by French, Russian and Asian (China / Japan). That also reminds me of the breakfast which is great and very varied providing options for all tastes which was great.",
            "We were so excited to return to the Pullman after visiting three years ago and we are certain we will be back. From the moment we arrived the staff treated us like royalty. Nothing was too much to ask for and in fact, we were constantly being offered more than we could have hoped. In particular Albert and Roxana stood out to us as being the best examples of leadership. They seemed to be there the whole time and were never standing still. Roxana was serving at Vero's at night and cleaning the beach with her operations staff at 7am the next morning while Albert was serving coffees and food at breakfast and collecting towels by the pool in the afternoon. No task was \"below\" them and their staff interacted with them in a way that highlighted the respect that they have for them. In particular, there were two areas that we were assisted in that went above and beyond: 1. After a day of surprising sun we both got burnt. Roxana saw us at dinner and bought us a bag of fresh aloe gel. 2. I mentioned to Albert I am gluten free on the first day and he ensured there was gluten free pasta, pizza dough and bread available at all times. Every accommodation was made without needing to ask. We were able to go to the spa a few times in our visit and at all times we were amazed at not only the incredible treatments, but also at the friendly and accommodating service. Pong, at Vero, does an incredible job in his role at the restaurant and ensured we always had our favourite table available and the staff at the pool couldnt do enough for us! In particular Bonus was amazing! On the final day we reflected on if we had to say one thing that could be better what would it be? And honestly couldnt come up with anything! We wanted for nothing and got so much more! The room and facilities are of course incredible (as they were the first time we stayed) however it really is the service that Roxana, Albert and your fabulous staff provided that made our week a true \"Luxury Escape\"!",
            "The hotel is located in one of the most quiet and beautiful location of the island, overlooking Naithon beach, where we could easily access from the hotel as we felt like taking an alternative from the infinite pool. The room was very comfy, perfectly clean, and well maintained, we staid in the grand ocean type that gave us the feeling to wake up in the blue sky water of the Andaman sea. We enjoyed the many different offerings prepared by the food and beverage team, from the pool bar, the sky lounge to the authentic Italian restaurant. Service was friendly and very professional, with attention to details and always willing to go the extra miles to satisfy our requests. We felt like home away from home during those two days, very enjoyable, we will surely come back! Luc & Nuch",
            "THE PULLMAN ARCADIA PHUKET We stayed here in November 2020 An Amazing Hotel exceptional facilities the rooms are very nice and large we were in the deluxe room the large bed was very comfortable and later we upgrades to the ocean room as per name a great view of the sea. The deluxe and Ocean room had large balconies with table and chairs including a comfortable sofa which you can stretch out on and relax. There was a large smart TV with plenty of programs to choose from and there was many socket options for various electrical appliances. If you are looking for a hotel that offers something a bit special then I would recommend The Pullman Arcadia. The swimming pool is huge with plenty of loungers around it and there is a shallow area which is safe for children and a very good service from the bar staff. The staff throughout the hotel was very nice, helpful and attentive. The breakfast buffet was exceptional and had an incredible choice of food and drinks everything was delicious. The only downside I can say is the Hotel is situated in a relative quite area, you would need taxis to go to anywhere that has good night life and choices of good restaurants but the hotel restaurants are very good but on the expensive side. We ate in the Italian restaurant two times and the food as well as the ambiance was exceptional. But if you want a quality hotel away from the hustle of the night life and loud music etc. such as Patong area then have a look at the Pullman.",
            "This was first time staying at the Pullman. I was a little concerned about the 30/45 minutes distance from all the major towns and city activities but it actually worked out for the best as were we able to truly retreat, relax and enjoy the vacation. The guests are global. I find that everyone is quite peaceful and attentive to their own experience but are kind enough to extend a hand for a picture if need be. The resort provides a private beach entry to Naithon Beach but locals also come to enjoy. There are plenty of carts, shops and restaurants nearby enjoyment as well. The attendants were very timely, kind and patient. Willing to bend and yield to last minute changes almost everytime. The breakfast was perfect. The choices that were offer were amazing there was something for everyone: Asian, American and European Menu options. We traveled for New Years and each and every attendant including the Head Chef and Director of Operations came to our special dinner Table arrangements and greeted us inquiring of our satisfaction and stay. It is truly a lifestyle experience at the Pullman for whatever you've come for. Although on vacation, I was able to conduct business and get work done online via their activity room as there was a computer provided. As an athlete, there was fitness accessibilities including a gym, specialized equipment and a rooftop that overlooks the water and pool area. The pool was also a pleasant place to relax near, gemreat for catching up to reading or just relaxing in a hammock. I participated in water aerobics that was relaxing and fun also. Overall. My experience was fulfilling. The only thing I was suggest is an all night bar for guest. The closing hours were a bit too early.",
            "My daughters and I just completed two weeks in the Phuket Sandbox program at the Pullman Phuket Arcadia. As a 20 year+ resident of Thailand, I can say with supreme confidence that our stay at this resort was one of the finest experiences we've ever had in Thailand. First and foremost, this Sandbox stay was organized, safe, and efficient. Communication before our booking was clear and detailed, and the hotel provided all necessary paperwork for our Certificate of Entry, as well as planned our Covid tests during our stay. All staff (and guests) maintained appropriate distancing, correctly wore masks, and kept hands clean by using one of the numerous hand sanitizing stations around the resort. In short, all health and safety protocols were what one would expect from a 5-star resort. Moreover, the property is stunning and the service is first-class. The breakfast buffet was outstanding and had a full range of Thai and international favorites. It is rare to see my girls eager to wake up in the morning, but this breakfast had them up each day ready to go! Lunch and dinner were excellent as well, with lots of healthy options for all tastes. The food truly was a highlight. Aside from relaxing by the amazing pool area, we really enjoyed the Library. There was a nice area for playing cards, and the pool table was a place for some good family fun. The lobby area and attached bars/restaurant were impressive. The photos don't do the property justice; the daily sunsets, drinks, and tapas were a favorite! And, of course, the rooms were outstanding. We enjoyed two ocean view connecting rooms, and the balconies got plenty of use. And, or course, Pullman Arcadia makes everything very efficient and easy with a special app. You can order room service, organize transportation, chat with the front desk, and schedule a room cleaning right from your phone! Very cool concept. And, for those of you who enjoy exercise, the fitness room is open 24 hours. That proved to be useful as we got over jet lag at the beginning of our trip. However, what makes this hotel truly superior, in my opinion, is the service. The Director of F&B, Albert, really went out of his way to make our stay enjoyable. He was able to get to know all the guests while simultaneously managing the entire 5-star experience. The front desk staff, especially Ing, Baifern, Jane, Tiffy, and Bella, always went out of their way to chat with us and ensure everything was wonderful. The servers at the restaurant were kind and efficient, and we knew them all by name by the end of our stay. In short, the staff at the Pullman truly represents the best of Thai culture and hospitality. So, to sum up, if you are looking for a wonderful and safe experience in the Sandbox, you can't go wrong with Pullman Arcadia Phuket!"

            "The Pullman resort has everything you need for a great holiday. Its clean & the staff are very friendly. There are 3 great swimming pools to choose from & its right at the beach. The rooms are kept beautifully cleaned by the lovely Dee Die. Ive never smelt sheets that smell sooo good. We also Di a great cooking class in the Thai restaurant.",
            "Hotel location is amazing if you are looking for peace of mind and a little seclusion. Still near to some night markets in Karon and the beach is less crowded than the one in Patong and extremely clean and sandy (not rocky). The hotel facilities are well kept and the staff is super friendly with a smile on their faces all the time. Shuttle bus within the hotel premises is readily available (it drops you off to other sections of the hotel or to the welcome lobby to grab a taxi or for being picked up by the transportation offered by tour companies). The food quality is very good. The hotel has 5 swimming pools spread along the premises with lush gardens. There is also a kids club, spa and fitness center. It is a bit on the high spectrum when it comes to accomodation prices, but you get what you pay for. I booked a room with twin beds and additional bed for 8 nights. The room was a bit compact however it had a balcony which overlooked the ocean and the view was simply amazing. An unforgetable experience.",
            "Location was fairly good. Very large resort. Takes a while to work out how to navigate it, so keep the map with you. Executive club was fairly good, felt a bit left out because we weren't regulars....first time I have felt a bit alienated in an Executive Lounge. Breakfast overall was good in both areas. Cappuccinos in the executive lounge are pretty cold, so I just had them in the normal breakfast area, Salt. Bed was very hard, even with a couple of toppers on it (pretty much like thin quilts) Suite was good size. We had to mention about timing of cleaning the rooms as they were beginning to do them around 4.30pm, even though they had been cleaning rooms near our since breakfast, somehow ours would not be done until really late and it made it hard to get ready to go to drinks in the evening as you never knew when they were going to knock on the door and come in to clean. Some of the pools weren't cleaned all that well because there were trees nearby, so lots of leaves etc floating in the water.....the two pools near Lotus Wing are very cold. They should prob get better umbrellas (larger and darker) to shade better, as you would still get burnt sitting under them. Would we stay again, not sure. Some people have been staying there for years and are really loyal to the brand. I stayed for a change and because I got a good deal at the time.",
            "This was a fantastic stay from start to finish for us. Immediately at check in, the gm Markus came over to introduce himself and went above and beyond in recognizing our lifetime diamond status with Hilton. He pointed out our over 880 stays and said it certainly stood out on the check in list lol. Markus took the time to do our check-in himself and we had cold towels and delicious drinks during the process. I booked the 5 night stay on points and although we were unable to get an upgrade to a suite, Markus had us in a top floor ocean room which was amazing and had breathtaking views. We also had access to the lounge as diamond members where a delicious breakfast buffet and made to order egg dishes were served. Along with an evening happy hour with a gray rotating spread for a pre-dinner snack and cocktail. The staff in the lounge were absolutely fantastic, memorizing our preferred seating location and drink orders by the second day of our stay. The resort layout is quite expansive and has everything you need should you not want to venture out. I recommend walking around and checking out local shops and eateries both in and out of the resort. The rooms were cleaned multiple times a day and with extreme care. Turn down service was provided and excellent. All our requests were promptly handled and we really could not have asked for more from this property. Everything is pretty well thought out and runs like a well oiled machine. We will definitely be back!",
            "My Family (of 6) really enjoyed the Hilton Phuket Arcadia Resort and Spa. It is a very large resort. So big that you have to take a trolley from the front gate to the hotel (which gets a little old after a few days) The hotel has a beautiful lobby that really sets the atmosphere for this hotel. The check-in staff were excellent. The gentleman that checked us in, actually escorted my family up to our rooms and made sure our luggage was accounted for and asked if he could make any arrangements for us. What a great start to a great stay at this hotel! We used the staff multiple times to arrange taxis and tours. Super helpful! The rooms are very nice and clean, and we had a perfect view of the ocean. The bathroom is large and well stocked. The beds are comfortable, but the pillows were too big. The furnishig were modern and new. The staff made sure that our rooms were all right next to each other (3 rooms for our family of 6). That was much appreciated! Breakfast in the morning at the Sails Restaurant was good, and the staff were very nice and accommodating. They even made us a box breakfast for a very early excursion we had planned. We ordered it the night before. The only other time we ate at the hotel was also at the Sails Restaurant for their Evening Seafood Buffet. (If I remember correctly this is on Saturday nights.) This was the only disappointment we experienced at the hotel. After looking over the small assortment of seafood that was actually offered, my family just wanted to leave and go for dinner somewhere else. We did. There is a nice lounge and bar just off the lobby that had live music each night. The entertainment did a nice job. There are some nice shops around the resort. We bought a beautiful tapestry from a rug store, but the salesman was way too aggressive in trying to get us to buy additional rugs. Note for HH members - I love that this facility actually goes the extra mile for Hilton Honors members. I had gold status and they really went out of their way to make sure our experience there was a memorable one. Our familys favorite part was watching the storms roll in from the safety of our room decks. They came in the evenings and we would watch the amazing lightning displays. They arent as fun when you are outside shopping at the markets =) We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and we will definitely use them again the next time we are in Phuket.",
            "This is our second stay at the Arcadia and we enjoyed it even more than the first time. We were very well treated as Diamond members with an upgraded room on the 12th floor, a beautiful welcome back sign in flowers on the bed, a vase of flowers, chocolates and fruit and a big diamond on our breakfast table which ensured the cafe lattes and fresh juice kept flowing. The ladies who cleaned our room were fantastic, organizing my cosmetics, adding a little rack on the balcony to dry bathing suits, and keeping our room well stocked with towels and toiletries. The grounds are well maintained with beautiful flowers and trees. Our only little negative is the need to pay for alcoholic beverages in the Executive Lounge, which wasnt the case on our previous visit. We arent big drinkers by any means but were disappointed at this change which seemed to us like a lowering of Hilton standards. Wed definitely stay at the Arcadia again.",
            "I rarely bother to write reviews here but this hotel was so good I felt compelled to do so. Where to start... ALL of the staff here are so lovely. They are serene, graceful and could not be more helpful. WORLD CLASS service. I have been to 5 star hotels all over the world and I can tell you that the housekeeping staff are the best! Every day our rooms was cleaned immaculately. It was the little things that counted. Hanging up our washing outside on the balcony to dry, laying little cotton sheets of cloth next to our basin and neatly laying out our toiletries. The restaurant staff were so welcoming every day and the experience you have from the second you enter is superb. The staff making the omelettes took pride in how they made them, and boy were they terrific - so delicately shaped in the pan. Food quality was exceptional at all restaurants. Breakfast, lunch and dinner were all amazing. The pool staff could not be more helpful, coming around and serving drinks right by the pool. The spa staff were exceptional, professional and offered a wonderful service. The cold lychee drink before the massage and the honey and ginger tea afterwards were classy. I want to congratulate this hotel for being a truly outstanding world class hotel, for its amenities but more importantly, its staff. AMAZING",
            "Generally a good hotel with many amenities! Pros are that it's very near to some good food places at karon beach, about 10mins walking. The beach is awesome and very clean with a lifeguard at watch while some watersports activities also take place. The room with the seaview had stunning sunset landscapes! Kitchens seemed very clean and food was always freshly prepared with local ingredients. On the cons side the breakfast although plentiful was always full of people, making it very overcrowded at almost any time after 8.30 and with pool tables constantly occupied. At arrival the reception kept us at least 45mins filling out paperwork without offering any water, tea or something after our 15hour flight, while the dine-in mandatory service (until pcr tests are out) was charged! The beach doesn't have sunbeds or umbrellas thus making it inaccessible during the afternoon scorching sun. Lastly, hotel food and drinks prices are leaning to the extreme if you think that for a 10min walk you get the same quality of fried rice for 100-150 baht.",
            "Set well back from the road that separates the hotel from the beach, all other hotels are on the road edge, they must experience road noise all day/night!! Fantastic grounds, great choice of swimming pools, different breakfast locations which make you feel as though you arent in a resort. And, a choice of different restaurants and bars for evening meals and drinks. Hilton status members, I.e gold and diamond receive additional privileges whilst onsite. Would suggest anyone coming to Karon beach stays here and they wont be disappointed, be sure and get a sea view room in the middle of the upper floors, Section D (Lotus suite) on the 9th floor upwards have unspoilt sea views and set far back from the main road!",
            "This Hilton property is one of the most beautiful resorts we have stayed at. Its quite large and a trolley will take you to various locations on the property. We arrived at Phuket airport and there was a little confusion about our transfer to the hotel. I pulled up the email confirmation and we figured it out. The van was very comfortable and had WiFi. They had cool jasmine infused wash cloths and bottles of water for us. Check in went smoothly and we had our rooms by 12:30. It was a pleasant surprise to be able to get settler in early. We checked out the Panorama Lounge (my husband is a Diamond member). What an amazing view of the beach! We really only used this lounge to grab a soft drink once in a while. We were so busy! We had lunch by the pool and saw a peacock strutting around the area. There were many cats in the foliage in this area too. The beach area is beautiful and there is a security guard helps you to cross the road. There are lots of restaurants and little stores within walking distance. Tuk tuks and taxi stands outside the entrance also. Barter with the tuk tuks for a better price. Our rooms were spacious and clean. Slippers, two bottles of water and coffee/tea was provided for you. Loved the balcony and comfy couch to sit on. The bed was very comfortable also. The pools beach bar had a happy hour from 5:00-6:00 every day. Buy one get one free. The bar in the lobby had the same deal 6:00-7:00 pm every day also. The staff were wonderful. We had a delicious breakfast buffet included because of our Diamond status. There were so many options. Very nice meal by the pool. The staff are amazing here. Friendly and helpful to us all. We each had a box of chocolates and a plate of fruit delivered to our rooms. This was very nice. We plan on visiting again!"

Both the road and market was noisy all the time. It was no problem moving rooms where we then spent our three week stay knowing we could go back to the room and relax. Breakfast was nice but after 3 weeks was a bit repetitive. Fruit, yoghurts, croissants, omelettes and local curry on offer. Tea coffee and juices all nice. Roof top pool was a smaller area than we expected but still lovely and kept remarkably clean. The whole hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff couldn't do enough. The main beach was a 10 min walk away and the main areas Approx 15-20 mins walk. Plenty of taxis should you need",
            "We stayed at the Marina Hotel, Phuket as it was part of a package deal. It's not the kind of place that I normally book, I prefer more traditional style hotels/resorts. The room is a good size, very good sized bathroom and a well stocked mini bar. The only problems with the room were: very firm mattress, the shower over the bath design means water from the shower leaks onto the floor under the glass screen, the balcony door isn't sound proof so noise from the market, road below is continuous. All the staff are very friendly and accommodating. The hotel is very clean and has good amenities, the included breakfast buffet was very good, but no bacon which is disappointing for a Buddhist country. Only about 1km from all the usual attractions, Jungceylon shopping centre, Patong beach and Bangla Road. Well worth the walk, everyday take a different route and see a lot of different but same, same things. Good street markets next door and across the road, mini mart and chemists. Plenty of shopping at a nice walking distance. Good variety and number of small places to eat and plenty of choices for night markets. There is a fitness centre on the 9th floor and the views from the roof top bar are excellent. Bar prices are very steep, but they don't complain if you take your own beers up. Recommend the hotel but opt for a room away from the road noise.",
            "An oddly long hotel. Nice modern rooms. Modern style construction is beautiful, but crowded and small like the modern condos in Thailand. The rooms are probably 22sqm. I stayed alone so wasn't too pack. For two people would be a little tight for a 4 star hotel. Location B+. On the main road, but a tad far for walking to the beach. I got lucky and traveled right after COVID-19 lockdown so the price was very affordable. Normally, it would be quite expensive. Nice modern swimming pool and bar area. Again, would be too tight when it's full. One knock against the hotel is the parking. The 'turtleback' that prevents water from flooding the basement parking is too high. It would damage most regular sedan/saloon's bottom of the car. And there was not even 20% parking for the number of rooms. So people resorted to street parking. Not ideal for a 4 Star hotel.",
            "The hotel room was spacious and a great escape from the heat outside. There was a balcony and lots of windows bringing in light throughout the day. There are no luggage racks so if you have plenty of suitcases, you'll have to put them on the floor or use all the desk space available. There is a mini-fridge in the room that is already filled with some minibar drinks, but you can still fit in a few of your own bottles. Since it is so hot in Phuket, I would advise you to put in the 2 free bottles of water in the fridge every evening so that they are chilled when you take them with you for your day trips in the morning. The hotel is nice and clean. The rooftop pool has a beautiful view. The pool looks small and narrow when you first walk outside onto the rooftop, but there is a wider area further on the left along with two showers where the \"front of the boat\" is. (In case you did not know already, the top of the hotel is shaped like a boat.) The hotel is well air-conditioned except for the hallways to the elevator and the stairwell so brace yourself for the couple minutes where you are walking there. In the elevator, your hotel keycard will only work on the floor where your hotel room is except for the communal floors such as the roof and the gym. The stairwell is right next to the elevators so if you need to walk down a couple of floors to your friend's room, it should be no problem as long as you don't have any accessibility needs, otherwise you'll have to ask your friend to escort you. The cafe inside the hotel is pretty good. I enjoyed the watermelon fruit smoothie I had there and my parents enjoyed the mango sticky rice. During the day, it may seem like your hotel is in a quiet and boring area, but at night, the markets across the street and on the side of the hotel will come alive. There is also a 7 Eleven if you need to grab a quick snack or a pharmacy right next door if you need anything. The only two negative experiences I had while staying at the hotel was that there was one day where housekeeping didn't give us any of the smaller towels and the next day marked our room as missing two small towels when we never received them. If you are ever missing anything from your room, make sure you note that so you don't get in trouble for not having something you never received. My sister found some marks on her sheets on the first night so she had to call housekeeping to get them changed. Housekeeping arrived right away and changed the sheets on both twin beds. Housekeeping, for the most part, responds really fast at this hotel!",
            "Stayed for 3 nights, location is a 15 minute walk to beach there is a late night market outside hotel not many bars or restaurants though. Room was ok main let down was sheets were like a silky polyester which felt damp all the time and pillows were like rock asked if they had softer ones but no. Breakfast was buffet not all that good had a boiled egg was virtually raw mainly caters for Asian market not international. Got a magnificent pool on roof with great views good sunbeds, bar free towels. Only thing that let it down was the BOOM BOOM of the music all day long volume control must have broken no chance of reading a book put us off so went to beach. Don't think would stay again due to atmosphere round pool.",
            "We stayed here for three night as a family of three and it was three nights too many. Upon check in the receptionist spent the whole time on the phone while taking our passports etc The hotel is located on a very busy road so the noise of motor bikes can be heard late into the night. This and the very hard beds gave for three restless nights. The rooftop pool is obviously the main selling point of this hotel but it seems the rest has been forgotten. Our room was rather small but reasonably well equipped with a cockroach quashed on the wall. You get two small bottles of water per day if you require anymore you are required to pay for them. Breakfast was basic but all the essentials were there. Upon checkout we were informed we would be charged as there was a T Spoon missing from our room. At first we thought the lady was joking but it turns out she was deadly serious.",
            "Stayed here last year a delayed review, first room was dirty and full of flies so they immediately moved us to a new room, Ive never slept on a more uncomfortable bed, it was literally a hard base with a thin mattress hard as a rock, and the king bed is not a king bed its two single beds put together. Didnt have one good nights sleep there, breakfast was garbage, Ive stayed in Patong 6 times and this is the worst hotel Ive been in, full of Indian travellers, the only good point is the pool but its not enough to compensate for the uncomfortable rooms. I could go on but I wont. Dont stay here dont know how they get such good reviews.",
            "Let me be very clear that the positive reviews are for the wonderful rooftop swimming pool and superb rooms only. We stayed here only for one night so cannot point out more about the pros and cons but one negative about the hotel is that they have pasted notices everywhere which says if you do this 5000 baht fine if you do that 3000 baht and it is everywhere in the hotel Room,lift,staircase,lobby,pool, bar and where not I have shared a pic of that. I felt like a kid being warned by school teacher which I dont feel good in a hospitality business. We have been around to many countries and places and this was our third time to Phuket but never felt like this. I will not consider this hotel neither recommend my dear ones just because of this notices which makes you feel like you are in a jail and if you break any rule you are going to pay a hefty amount for that.for example they will take fine of 5000 baht if you boil milk in the kettle provided in the room for tea/coffee. Although we dont need it but what of we were accompanied by a one year old infant. The kettle is easy available for 600 baht so just in case it is spoiled by a customer by mistake you can simply let it go with a smile after all the marina phuket is charging a lot for a day. Dear people if you are happy with being reminded of not doing anything wrong every minute you can visit this place rest please avoid.",
            "We stayed at the Marina Phuket Hotel for 4 nights. The check in process was very smooth, because of Thai Gov rules it was required to isolate in the hotel for 1 night, which was easy as they provided room service (lovely food and drinks that came quick). One reception member also let me borrow her phone charger as I was yet to buy a travel adapter, which was very lovely of her! The room was super clean and tidy, had a deluxe double which was plenty of room for 2 people. Toiletries provided as well as towels and coffee/tea/water. Shower pressure was fine. The rooftop infinity pool with bar was definitely the best part about this hotel! So many sun beds (shaded and non shaded) with towels provided. The drinks at the bar were reasonably priced, about 190 Baht for a cocktail- bar staff also bought your drinks over to you. Breakfast was ok, there wasnt as much buffet selection as other hotels I have stayed in but the food that was provided was nice. Ranged from fruit, toast and cereals to cooked meals with noodles and meats etc. In terms of location, the hotel is spot on. It is 4/5 minutes walk away from the main strip road (so about 10 from Bangla Road) 2 minutes from a 7/11 shop and just next door there is a coffee smoothie shop and a chemist. Theres always taxis waiting outside as well which helps. The gym was fine, had a few cardio machines and a few different weight machines and mats. A few dumbbells also. The best part of the gym was the view from the machines (have uploaded a pic) was so beautiful while working out! Overall I really recommend this hotel, the airport transfer was a little bit overpriced but nothing can do about that really, the value for money in terms of the room and service provided is so worth it though! The staff are super friendly and attentive, nothing is too much hassle for them, definitely recommend staying here.",
            "Walkable distance to the patong beach and Bangla streets where all the bars are. Its a bit far if you want to do island hoping tours. They offer free breakfast for my stay and free beach towel rentals. The hotel hall ways to the room was outdoors so you can feel the heat once you walk out of your room. Its a safe location hotel because it requires a room key to access your floor. The pool was on the roof and it was really nice to lounge in the area. It had loud music almost like the pool parties in miama beach. The room was very modern and clean. I like how my bathroom had its own area that is a bit discontinued to my room. Good thing they have a balcony so I can dry my clothes. Wish they had a rack to hang the clothes though. The beds were supper comfortable, but for some reason the 2 full bed in my room was actually connected so it made seem like a king bed. Service was quick and they had a tour guide in the lobby which made it convenient. A lot of atm and 7/11 near by and there is even a fruit market."

            "3 . 1 2 . 1 , . . . . . Sophia . Jah, Napha, Opor . . . . . A few days ago, I stayed with my family for 3 nights in a two bedroom pool villa. First of all, disappointing thing is that there are only bedrooms on the 1st and 2nd floors, and there is no common space such as a living room, so there was no place for the family to be together. Around the pool on the 1st floor, there were wide sofas, table, and sunbeds as well as a nice garden, but there were a lot of mosquitoes and insects, so even for a short while, my family were bitten here and there. Other than that everything was wonderful. Breakfast wasn't a lot of variety, but each one was delicious, the view from the beach was nice, and even though the public pools also were nice, but the private pool was large enough that we didn't have to go to the public pool that much. Jaras restaurant was a bit pricey, but most of the food was excellent, living up to its reputation. And above all, each and every one of the staff was kind, so I was able to have a good time anywhere. Sophia, who was our butler, was very attentive to our convenience from time to time. Especially since it was a night flight, we had to spend time at the hotel late after check-out, but she welcomed us and took care of us until the moment we left the last door. Every time I go to the pinto restaurant for breakfast or lounge, the staff, for instance Jah, Napha, Opor, always come first to ask if I need anything, and when I ask for help, they sincerely helped. Thanks to them, I was able to finish the trip happily. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude. We hope to see you again next time. Thank you.",
            "Our stay here did not get off to a good start as upon arrival we were informed that the Ocean View Club room we had booked was not available due to maintenance. We were given a so called upgrade to an awful Lagoon Villa with a pool outside that was shared with other rooms so lying in your bed you saw people floating past your room in the pool looking in so no privacy at all. Thankfully after one night we were moved to the room that we had booked and from then on all went well. Due to the Corona virus the hotel was empty and sometimes we were the only ones at the breakfast buffet. Buffet was good but nothing special. All the staff we met were friendly and it is worth paying the extra for the club amenieties. Nice choice of sandwiches and cakes for afternoon and canapes and free flow drinks in the evening. Special mention to Pang in the club area for looking after us so well. Nice area to sit outside the club in the evening until they turn on the spotlights which are much too bright and it is like sitting on a floodlit football pitch.. The beach is beautiful but the loud music from the club next door does get annoying at times. All in all this hotel can be recommended",
            "My partner and I had the pleasure to spend two days/nights in the InterContinental Phuket recently. Facilities: All the facilities are absolutely fantastic and very well kept. Numerous swimming pools dotted around the property and a great well-equipped 24h gym. Restaurants: Breakfast at Pinto was delicious and we also had the opportunity to have an evening meal at their beach front restaurant, Pine. All food and beverages were of the highest quality. Staff: All staff members were fantastic ambassadors for the hotel. They went above and beyond on numerous occasions. A special mention goes to the concierge service which looked after our car and luggage. Rooms: This is where my overall rating fell down. The rooms are immaculate, with fantastic amenities and design. My only issue (and a major one at that) is that there is little sound protection between the rooms. You can hear most, if not all, of the comings and goings of the room next door. While my neighbours were not being loud in the slightest, it was still annoying that I could hear (and assume they could hear) everything that was going on. Being able to hear your neighbour's coffee machine brewing at half past six in the morning wasn't the pleasantness way to start the day. I would expect a five-star hotel that charges upwards of $300++ per night to at least have put some consideration into this element. It's a shame, because otherwise it's a great hotel.",
            "Although this is a beach front property its only really beach front if youre staying in a Club Room. The rest of the rooms are at the back of the hotel across a road. Its a short walk to the beach if youre staying in one of the non Club Rooms or a buggy can take you to the beach. Its not an issue but just in case youre expecting a traditional beach front hotel just be mindful of which rooms you are booking. The Club facilities are limited. Only open at certain times. No fresh juices throughout the day. The staff at Pinto restaurant where breakfast is served are great. Poranee, the restaurant manager is very hands on. Lookgate, another member of her team also great. The staff on the beach are also great. Lots of local restaurant options on the beach but if you walk about 7-10 minutes further to Kamala town which is on the left just after Fantasea theres a great restaurant called Lord of the Sea Restaurant- amazing fresh fish. Great fresh juices too. Theres also a market which opens Monday and Fridays just opposite where you can buy the usual souvenirs etc.. also local cheap eats. The beach itself is wonderful... lovely warm water.",
            "The hotel is new and nicely decorated. The mountain side is larger and relatively quiet. You get the feeling of tranquility that you may be in the northern part of Thailand with some photogenic spots. The beach side is a much smaller but offers a nice ocean view with a large swimming pool at the Kamala beach front and restaurants/club lounge on the side. We stayed for 3 nights in the Club Ocean View Room during the long weekend in Thailand so the hotel is quite crowded. However, the staffs are very attentive and hospitable. Originally I requested the high-floored room at the time of booking. Due to the high occupancy, we only get the room on the 2nd fl with blocked view of the ocean, so we are a bit disappointed. Special thanks to Khun Nila who took our feedbacks into consideration and very accommodating in changing our room to the beach front side, when available. The beach front ocean view room offers an incredible ocean view but it is also right next to Cafe Del Mar club. We stayed during the night club grand re-opening after COVID-19, so it was noisy until very late at night. Anyone who books these rooms and wants a good night sleep should take this into account as well. The club facilities and staffs were excellent. Afternoon tea sets and evening cocktails have a variety of choices. We got the hotel promotional price with government discount program, so overall it was well worth the price. One thing we want to see improving was the breakfast. It offers a wide variety of choices, however, most Thai dishes were quite bland and not tasty in my opinion. At least in the club, there should be freshly squeezed orange juice or coconut milk. In addition, we wish there could be a working desk/station provided in the room.",
            "Our stay was back in November during the soft open. Despite a couple of hiccups here and there due to the newness of the hotel I would recommend and I believe it will only get better from here. The staff was very helpful and attentive from checkin, concierge desk, beach side bar all excellent and welcoming. They had great recommendations and always remembered us and inquired about our experience. The hotels is new well appointed and an instagrammers delight. The rooms are well designed we booked the King Superior Lagoon Access Room enjoyed the walk out to the pool. Jetted area provided at our doorstep. Be forewarned as its a pool access room you do forgo some privacy. The room was nicely decorated enjoyed the deep tub and bathroom amenities. Breakfast had a great spread and the beach side restaurant was affordable. Jaras was very expensive but the food and service was excellent. The drinks at this resort were really expensive for some reason and I don't believe it's worth the price, you may want to consider purchasing something at Duty free or at the airport. Overall excellent hotel, service A+, pools were great, beach is great and it's new what else can you ask for?",
            "We started our vacation at the Intercontinental at Kamala beach. We chose this brand new hotel because we wanted a quiet and relaxing start before exploring more of quirky Thailand. After a 11h flight and another 30min drive from the airport (for 750 baht!!!), we were happy to finally arrive at the hotel and our first reaction was confusion. Turns out, the main building of the hotel (reception, breakfast, spa, rooms and villas) is not located at the beach! Instead a big road with quite heavy traffic parts the hotel from the beach. The receptionist informed us then, that the beach wing is only for Intercontinental Club Members - with a separate breakfast restaurant. Luckily all hotel guests are allowed to use the beach, but only after crossing the street via a hotel tunnel. We were really shocked and confused since there was absolutely no information (not on the website itself, nor on the booking portals) that the hotel is split into two buildings. To make things worse, you have absolutely no view to the beach from the main building because it is built to face the mountains. After surviving the first shock, we didnt have to wait long for the second one. We were informed that during our stay, the complete beach wing was booked by an obviously very rich Indian family, who was celebrating their 25year anniversary. We never witnessed an Indian party before, but they sure were saving no expenses. They must have spend so much money, that the hotel totally forgot their normal guests. Due to the booking of the complete beach wing, there were only limited lounges at the beach for other guests. These lounges were moved to the public beach and there was absolutely no service at all. No drinks, no food - we were lucky to find a water dispenser. All this would be tolerable, if the hotel would have done more than a little excuse of 20% off the spa treatments. It is absolutely okay for a hotel to hold big receptions or weddings, but after paying more than 630 for 2 nights and not being able to use all hotel facilities, nor getting any service, we were really pissed. Fortunately, the hotel itself is beautiful, rooms have a decent size and are quiet and breakfast was delicious. However it is a huge dealbreaker to find out, that the booked splendid beachfront sanctuary in Phuket is actually not a beachfront sanctuary, by all means. Plus Kamala beach is an absolute pain in the ass, we had a feeling we landed at the Ballermann at Mallorca and not in Thailand.",
            "Intercontinental and similar large brands wouldnt normally be on my radar but given the world as it is Kamala Beach had been recommended as a good option for a bit of life and this hotel was the most obvious choice for our tastes. Something stopped me from booking three nights and Im glad I didnt. Two was fine. The good. The beach is stunning. The location on said beach is perfect particularly for Phuket where there are stricter beachfront building rules than Samui. Our room is nice and fresh and modern (suite on the beachfront one floor up so ideal view) but small for a suite. The saving grace was the food is generally excellent. Breakfast was lovely for us best of all hotels we stayed in this trip. The mixed. Welcome left a bit to be desired. Admittedly we were early but were not sought out when our room was ready. The ambience is that of a large international brand obviously unsurprising and as intended just not for us. The staff were more than fine but lacked the warmth and humour (and possibly empowerment?) of elsewhere. The hotel is split between beach and hillside so if you are on the beachside you really feel like a small boutique hotel and you dont easily access the full estate. The club facility is VERY limited drinks OK but food pretty poor understandable with COVID-19 but could do (a lot) better. Particularly for vegetarians. The bad. We arrived Sunday so there was pretty horrible (IMHO) DJ music playing for brunch. We were told it would be gone on Monday, but it played all day albeit quieter. Really not our bag. Our room was nice, but the balcony was open to next door so lost most privacy. The wine pours were mean in the restaurant (in fairness an issue everywhere in Thailand that needs to be addressed). The Value. Poor compared to other hotels stayed in even with residents discount we were getting a pool villa (with a lot of privacy) in a genuine five-star facility elsewhere for same money. It was noticeable that we were probably not the norm as I saw at least two people extend their stays while sitting in the club area. I nearly gave the IC a three because we really (really!) didnt like the music from the bar which was unavoidable for us having paid the extra for a beachfront however that might be just us, so I think this is a generous four.",
            "We stayed at this hotel for New Years and we must say it has its ups and downs. The hotel just opened and is absolutely beautiful. The rooms are great and the grounds are very nice with a beautiful temple in the middle. However the majority of the rooms is across a busy road from the beach, so you either have to walk in a tunnel under the road or take a buggy to go to the beach side. There were never enough beach beds available so we had to wait on the sand until some became available. The service in the hotel is not up to 5 star hotel standard. Most staff dont speak enough English to even order at the restaurant, which was very annoying and not relaxing to be on holiday. The minimum is that you want to be understood. There was a very small variety of choice for food at the beach restaurant and most dishes not available so once we asked for some grilled chicken for our daughter as we got tired of eating pizza every day and the waiter said that he will make this possible. At the end of a very long wait he brought us pizza with chicken. Very disappointing. The waiting time to get drinks was super long as well. So basically if you like good service - this hotel hasnt figured it out yet. No managers were to be seen, just clueless beginners staff. We arrived with a 4 year old and the hotel didnt have an extra bed available until 4 nights later. On the positive side though - the hotel is brand new with very good quality finishes. You wont be disappointed by the rooms. The restaurant food is amazing once you actually get it. There are three restaurants - one has great pizza and pasta and the other has fine dining Thai cuisine. The beach restaurant has very limited choice, so we were going to the restaurant next door called Shimmer. Which had much better service and a better variety of food. Breakfast is ok, but nothing special. Id recommend to wait until the hotel has settled in and improved their service until booking it.",
            "From the moment of checking in, this resort has been lovely. The receptionist was kind and was able to give us a room upgrade. We were escorted to our room via buggy (golf cart). The room was comfortable! Soft bed, lovely tub, and amazing views from our balcony. Room service was very tentative and provided the few things we asked for in a timely manner. There's an iron, ironing board, slippers, safe, and umbrella in the room. The bar area provided great items to choose from. Water is included. The coffee in the room, illy, I'm a fan of and is delicious. There is a tunnel underneath the main road that guests can walk from the main part of the resort that leads to the beach side (Kamala beach). When you get to the area closest to Kamala beach, there is a pool that is 4 feet 6 inches in depth. There you will find a superb Michelin star restaurant called Jaras. There is also a beach bar alongside the pool that opens until midnight. Being able to walk directly from the resort onto Kamala beach is wonderful. The staff throughout the resort are kind and courteous. The entire layout of the resort is eye catching. The white structure that is the focal point seen from the main entrance is the spa. I went there for a facial. They were accommodating and were able to squeeze us later in the evening. The part that I didn't like is that the facial I asked for included extractions as listed in the service menu. By the time the facial was complete, the extractions were never done. We were leaving the next morning, so I wouldn't have been able to return to the spa if they provided compensation. Perhaps I should've confirmed upon arrival to the appointment exactly what will be done so there's no questions asked. When I go back to Phuket, this is the resort I am returning to. Don't hesitate. You'll enjoy it here. Khab kun ka."

            "Sala Phuket is a beautiful serene resort. We love the gardens, the spacious rooms, pools, and beach. With so many comfortable beach lounges there are no guests rushing to the pool to reserve seats. There are also different types of lounges to choose from and all comfortable. We love the silence of the hotel without any music by the pool you can hear the waves of the beach and birds singing. Food at the hotel is delicious and with so many menu options you could happily enjoy your meals for a week and always try something new. That being said you are quite far from having a wide selection of good restaurant options and it does cost about $25 -$50 AUD for a two way taxi ride even ten mins away. We wanted a quiet isolated feeling so if you are looking to be close to bars or night life this is not for you. There is a local massage hut right next to the end of the resort which offers massages for 500 baht which is about $25 AUD an hour at todays exchange rates. One beautiful restaurant that is a 10 min drive away is called Baan Ar Jor. It is a private heritage home that the family has restored to a 4 bedroom hotel and restaurant and museum. The dinner was excellent and you get a fun insight into a traditional (wealthy) Thai family home. A local artist has also painted beautiful murals in the home and it was an absolute pleasure to have dinner and have a private tour. All staff here have been so warm and friendly and professional and housekeeping is good too. I would say the hotels greatest strength is its very high food service with reasonable prices which allows you stay in such an isolated position but also enjoy the experience without feeling trapped with overpriced dinners. Well done! We give this hotel a 10/10 and thank you so much for a wonderful and relaxing holiday!",
            "Travelled to Sala Phuket Mai Khoi Beach Resort and from the minute we set foot on the property we knew we were somewhere special. The welcome was fantastic and the news we would receive a room upgrade, made the long flight from Scotland all the more worthwhile. The room wasnt quite ready so we moved to a temporary room, which was fine, with the current Covid restrictions it meant we were grounded until we got the result of our airport rival test!! To be fair the bottle of Prosecco that arrived to welcome us, helped ease the pain! We received the green light on the Covid test and were moved to our home for the next 2 weeks, a pool villa, it was absolutely perfect, completely secluded our own little bubble. Main accommodation consisted of huge bed, wardrobe, TV, fridge and a safe. Along with plates, cutlery, cups and tea and coffee making facilities. The mini fridge is stocked with a variety of drinks and confectionary all available for a price. Water is supplied in sealed bottles every day. Outside are the shower, wc, bathtub with overhead chandelier! Double sinks and an enormous mirror, sun beds and an outdoor seating area. Oh and your very own Pool. Given all that it is fair to say we could have quite happily have spent the next 2 weeks cut off from the outside world and loved every minute of it!! We did however leave the room! The bar situated by the resort pools (which were never busy) and offer. Variety of seating arrangements from table and chairs to fantastic huge beds. These are an absolute must around Sunset time because they offer a stunning view. The bar staff are attentive and will ensure your glass is always full. The restaurant is wonderful, chilled relaxed and the food is fantastic. Service could be quicker, but you are on holiday!! The pools are a brilliant way to cool down, the nearby beds are comfortable and no need to get up a 5 to book one, we arrived a few days after 10am and had the pick of them all. Towels are available from the pool hit and the guys their will ensure you are regularly supplied iced water. We tipped them 50 baht, nice to be nice. The gym, well equipped, 2 rooms one with cardio machines, the other free weights, slots are allocated on request at reception, we never struggled to get a time. If you are looking to switch off, unwind in an absolutely wonderful place then, this is it.",
            "This was our 3rd visit to Phuket (7th to Thailand) and each time we have stayed in a different area. Our choice this time was the Sala Phuket Mai Khao Resort and as we leave today my husband and I will take with us memories of a peaceful and relaxing holiday. The resort is positioned in the centre of Mai Khao beach, and is perfectly situated for a morning beach walk and swim. We loved the fact that beach chairs are not permitted on the beach. Our villa was very spacious and the private pool was one of the largest pools we have experienced in our frequent stays in Thailand! The staff were exceptionally friendly everywhere in the resort no matter what their position. We enjoyed our conversations with the executive chef, Tony and hospitality intern, Lou as well as many others. I can thoroughly recommend the Spa especially the Thai Herbal facial. I think it was the most relaxing facial I have any experienced. The food was delicious although, I have to confess we mostly ate the Thai cuisine as we adore Thai food!! Thank you to all the staff for making our stay such a delightful experience.",
            "Another fantastic holiday at Sala Phuket. High standards throughout continue across the whole property. Attention to detail and wonderful contemporary accommodation really sets this place apart with a spectacular setting on an amazing beach. Anthony (GM) Tony (Executive Head Chef) and the rest of the team are dedicated to ensuring you have the best most relaxing time possible and nothing is too much trouble. For us the best place on Phuket to relax and unwind and we will return again!",
            "I chose SALA Phuket for my wife's bday. We live in Rawai in Phuket and I chose SALA because we had a beautiful stay in one of their Ko Samui properties, actually on my Birthday. The property is nice and has the SALA feel. It was a very rainy day upon check in and the Front Office was very friendly and efficient. Where it stumbles is in their F&B. The Villa we rented was very nice and what I expected. But this \"floating breakfast\" available was not a surprise but an upset episode. We ordered floating breakfast the night before. We realized that it is heavy rain and we ordered for 9:30 am. At 9:00 am they rightfully called us, because it was still raining and we stated very clearly that we still want our breakfast (its in a basked that floats, so we just dont float it) and we said yes, the order taker repeated the time. Then -- nothing, we called several times, they argued with us and that made things worse. Then after many calls , they kept saying it is on the way, and we still waited and waited. I also felt a lack of management in this property. I am a Hotelier, as I have often mentioned and I understand the ups and down specifically in a heavy rainy day. We have. little child, this was not an amusing experience. Finally a manager and staff came with the big floating tray and apologized and said they would not charge us for the breakfast. We really appreciate, but it is not about that. I am happy to pay. In any case, the breakfast was delicious",
            "Stayed end of Jan for a week in deluxe? balcony room. The reception area is tired with old red sofas. Reception staff are best described as professional with not much interaction. We were shown to our room which involved a near vertical climb up concrete steps. Not recommended for the less mobile! The room is old and tired and is best described as functional. Much is made of the outside bathroom but beware that the concrete block opposite is only across the yard and unless you want to share your morning ablutions and bodily functions with your neighbours be sure to pull the old beige curtains on the balcony. The shower is a small circular area which is enclosed with nylon curtains which I have not see since we stayed in a Holiday Inn 30+ years ago. The whole bedroom experience was a depressing and disappointing occurrence which we would not wish to repeat. The walk up to the restaurant/beach area is hazardous with uneven and broken pavers not helped after dark by inadequate lighting. The poolside area is a redeeming area with more than adequate amount of sunloungers, very high quality beach towels and very thick comfy cushions on loungers. Breakfast is an adequate but unimaginative experience. Food area is divided with bread, cereals and juices inside and the egg station outside. As some have previously said you have the option of ordering options off the menu of which there is a reasonable choice. Unfortunately we found on some occasions that staffing was inadequate and we were often waiting for our order to be taken and often a long delay for food to be served. Coffee order is taken as you sat down and seems to be brought from the kitchen, sometimes slowly. We were never asked if we wanted a second coffee and there did not seem to be a self service option that we could see. We were on half board option and could choose anything from the menu with a supplement for some more expensive options. The beach bar and beachfront is very nice and affords some excellent sunset views The whole pool area has obviously benefited from excellent investment but the rest of the hotel seems old and tired, possibly a post Covid effect which sadly lets down the pool and surrounding areas. I dont think we would rush back as there are hotels which gave seemed to have fared better and invested in refurbishment during and post pandemic.",
            "Definitely a memorable staying of ever! First of all, I start describing the amazing pool villa room, which has elegancy and naturalism blended with Thai style design, a marble pool quite big connected with a sala lounge, makes the villa a perfect oriental dream of luxury! The privacy is another important complement, makes you feel like your own resort paradise! The rooms are practical enough even for a couple celebration or a family staying vacation.The area of restaurant and bar lounge are beachfront and pool front, making you don't miss any breeze of the beach. Every night of our weekend there were some night attractions like DJ, singer at lounge, cinema and others, who made the atmosphere still more special. Food attractions, such as, ribs set menu night also made our staying so delicious. All the cares with COVID19, including use of masks , social distancing, availability of alcohol gel were perfectly clear and aligned with best practices. Other important point is the hospitality of the all the staff team, of the chef Tony, Basil and the Anthony the manager of the hotel, all concerned with our wellness, what reinforced the high level of professionalism and care of the team. Thanks for everyone! We are looking forward to back soon SALA!",
            "When I visit there was not many tourists as it was in COVID 19 period, so it was quiet private. I stayed one night at Deluxe room and another at Garden pool villa. Both rooms are well design with lots of space, I love the balcony in the room where you can relax and enjoy the breezy wind. The staffs are very friendly and ready to service with full service mind. However, I was disappointed with the main pool as it was in cleaning process which took 2 days to finished. In addition, the bar service was also didn't meet standard, even though it was a happy hour period, as they served sparkling wine that dead, no bubble at all.",
            "The photos online are very deceiving. The room was very gloomy with huge dirty brown curtains held together by sticky tape. At night there are only two electric lights in the room and you cant see anything. Its annoying to have the lavatory and basin outside. To wash your hands or go to the loo in the night is a major operation going through the endless heavy curtains. Everything is painted battleship grey or dark brown, and the architecture is hideous. The Portuguese tiles in the outside area are all stained, dirty and patchy from the weather. All the building work and carpentry has been done really cheaply, and everything is wobbly and sagging, including the floor in the restaurant. All the ugly concrete is cracking and the garden furniture is falling to bits. The entrance to the compound and the surrounding walls feel like a prison camp. At night the reception area is completely black. There are not enough sun beds and there is a smell of drains. It is very overpriced at 313 per night, and the cheapest wine on the menu was 40. The famous scented soap that other reviewers talk about didnt smell of anything. The owners seem to have given up on this place, and its hard to see how it can be saved. The property needs a complete rebuild using proper materials, teakwood etc. The staff are lovely.",
            "Just returned from a very enjoyable 10 day stay at Sala Phuket. We stayed in a Sala Pool Villa (villa 51) which we would definitely recommend having seen a balcony room which was given to us for a few hours when we arrived whilst our villa was being prepared - its definitely worth paying the extra. The outside space of the Sala Pool Villa is excellent and the pool is big enough for laps. The outside bathroom does take a little getting used to but the villas are designed so you cant be overlooked at all and you do quickly get used to it. The inside of the villa is a good size with everything you need and is kept spotlessly clean by the housekeeping staff including a thorough turndown service in the evening. The resort has 2 pools within very well kept grounds which lead down to the beach. The staff at the pools are excellent, keeping you well topped up with water and making sure the area is kept very tidy. There are no problems with securing sun loungers even though some people will always insist on securing them early - theres really no need!! The food quality at the Sala Restaurant is very good. Theres a really good choice at breakfast with a buffet and a la carte menu, good lunch menu and a varied dinner menu. We also used room service on a few occasions as this gives you more options for dinner and its really nice to be able to have dinner in the garden of your own villa. An unexpected surprise was the benefits for stays of 10 days or longer which included 15% off all food and drink, 20% Spa discount and complimentary daily tapas and cocktail at the Beach Bar."

            "The hotel speaks for itself - you won't be disappointed. However it's the personalised service by the staff that makes this place excellent - in particular, the Lobby team. An airline lost my luggage and the airline's customer service, along with the lost luggage team at Phuket airport, were extremely disappointing. Nevertheless, Ging and Jag in the Lobby team at Avista went above and beyond to keep pursuing updates on my lost baggage - they toiled with the airline/airport phone lines that were either constantly engaged or ringing out - they persisted to allow me the time to relax, while they dealt with my lost luggage. It was hugely appreciated. I don't normally write reviews, good, bad or indifferent. But on this occasion, I feel compelled to thoroughly recommend the Avista Hideaway Patong Phuket, purely due to the outstanding customer service afforded to me during me stay, especially by Ging and Jag. Thank you Ging and Jag!",
            "The Avista Hideaway Resort is situated just south of Patong, the main beach on Phuket island. The resort is spread out against a hillside and has a calm, quiet and relaxing atmosphere. It takes a little bit longer to get to the resort from the airport when using public transport or the minivans, since they will make their way through Patong and dropping off travelers along the way. There is a shuttle service available from the resort to Patong shopping area, but we opted to rent a scooter from a shop across from the resort, which was cheap and gives you freedom to come and go as you please. There is a designated parking area on the premises for guests. The check in process was quick and easy. A cold drink, snack and ice cold face cloths are provided while waiting for the paperwork, and all of this takes place in the big and spacious lobby with great views. Due to the location, rooms are spread out over various levels and buildings, so the rooms have both advantages and disadvantages. Rooms closer to the lobby means shorter and quicker walks when returning from outings, but a further walk away from the pools and the restaurant and breakfast area. And rooms further away from the lobby, other way around with walking distances. The rooms are nice and big, lots of dark wood which gives it a darker feel and ambience. Our Superior room had a balcony with outside seating as well. The bathroom has latches which can be opened and closed, making it feel slightly larger and even more spacious. The rooms are quipped with the standard amenities like toiletries, drinking water, safety deposit box and mini fridge. There are 3 pools, the smallest of which is only for adults, and 2 big pools. One is situated between two wings of rooms, and this pool tends to have more activity and noise because it seems like families with kids stay around here and some of the rooms here have access to the pool. The last big pool is at the end of the premises, furthest away from the main building and lobby area, but a bit more quiet and peaceful, leading to more relaxed afternoons next to the pool enjoying the views and sunsets, as well as the swim up pool bar. Breakfast is your standard buffet spread, with a decent selection and variety of food, juices and coffees. We also had a dinner buffet one evening which was also a good and tasty selection of dishes. The waiters and waitresses are all extremely friendly and helpful and the manager on duty will do rounds and chat with guests to make sure all is in order. All in all, this is a big resort, just outside of Patong, away from the noise and bustle, but still very easily accessible. The employees are all friendly, efficient and helpful and just adds to creating and experiencing a nice stay. The ambience is calm & relaxed, which for me is a bonus, nice to relax and unwind and recharge. I can surely recommend staying here for a relaxing, affordable and comfortable stay, yet still close enough to where all the action is.",
            "Our family stayed at the Hotel for two nights during January 2020 and it was a very nice stay. The hotel is situated on a mountain top near Patong Beach and there are frequent complimentary shuttle buses between the Hotel and the Beach, which we took during our stay. We also requested for the hotel to arrange for a private car for a 4-5 hour day tour around Phuket and also take us to the airport upon departure. Check in was great and we stayed in an Executive Room for the first night, decently sized around 65sqm and with a narrow view of the Adaman sea, partially blocked by some of the natural trees around the Hotel. After the first night, we requested for a better room and was nicely allocated the Deluxe Duplex Jacuzzi Suite, which did not have any views on the ground floor, but had a private rooftop that we could relax and enjoy some fresh air. My wife really loved the layout of the suite (which actually was very similar to the Executive Room) and my daughter enjoyed some fun in the Jacuzzi. As an Accor Plus member, we enjoyed the discounted onsite dining and the welcome drink vouchers at the Lounge (a bit small). The food at Vista for both breakfast and dinner was fantastic. Special thanks to Warichsa for assisting with our online reservation and the beautiful Niezel at the front desk for making us feel welcome during our stay and checking us out. The white dress gown worn by all front desk staff also added a taste of pureness to this unique hideaway Hotel. We would strongly recommend this Hotel if you are after a quiet and relax getaway, near a noisy and popular beach. SC",
            "This hotel lives up to its name of being a hideaway quite literally. Tucked away by the hillside, it is almost like a hidden sanctuary. From the driveway to the entrance courtyard, I was just enthralled. I stayed at the Executive Room at Block L. The room is spacious, and I understand that this room category is popular with honeymooners. The interiors are inspired by Thai architecture and bathed in sandy creamy colours. The bathroom comes with a separate rainfall shower and toilet. It also has a standalone bathtub. The room also has a daybed next to the bathroom with retractable foldable window panels. It has a study table right behind the bed together with all the main controls for the room such as lights and air-conditioning. The TV panel is tucked against the room wall, but can be moved and tilted to face the bed, however the quality was disappointing as the channels appear grainy and unclear. The bed also faces a wall of windows that leads to the balcony which faces the Hillside Pool (adult-only pool). From the balcony, I can see the lush forest nearby and further out into the sea. The hotel property is almost like a village of sorts, consisting of many buildings connected by numerous walkways and stairways. So, from my room, to breakfast at the Vista Restaurant; I will have to traverse through a series of stairways, walkways and a few elevators. Breakfast variety was pretty standard. The hotel boasts 3 swimming pools! My message experience at the Aqua Spa was so rejuvenating, I highly recommend it. The hotel despite being a hideaway offers shuttle services to nearby Jungceylon Mall which is walking distance to the famous Patong Beach which is an added convenience I greatly appreciate. Overall, the staff were very friendly and helpful, and I enjoyed my stay.",
            "Plain bad to call itself a 5 star hotel. The checking in process was mixed, some staff was helpful but the guy receptionist named Malener was rude, when asked to please bin a bottle of water while I was checking in he just ignored me. Then abt the room and the hotel itself: the hotel is built on a hill side so we need to be transported from the reception to our room and back again by a buggy, each ride was harsh and dangerous as well as the driver being unattentive. No warnings from the driver of the dangerous slope we nearly fell off and the turns were dangerous. On about the room, got upgraded to stay at a pool villa and really regretted it. 1) not safe the villa was furthest away from the main building and we did not feel safe at night as the door is poorly bolted so people can break in and can enter from the shower room (as seen in the photo) through the glass door that has no lock, for some weird reason. We did not feel safe at night. Also the bathroom door has no lock on it so anyone can enter our room at night. We even put a sofa to block anyone entering our room. 2) cleanliness was poor Walked into the room it smelted like deodorant just sprayed into the room to hide the unattractive smell. It was like we were fumed in the gas chamber, we had to open the door for a while for the smell to disappear. But then the mosquitos entered our room. The sofa was not clean as can be seen on the picture, red mysterious dots on the sofa everywhere. 3) the air- conditioner was so loud throughout the night. Disturbing our sleep. 4) bedding smell bad. The bedding gave a smell of unclean bedding, we had to put a small towel on our pillow and a big towel to use as our blanket. 5) eggshell in the omelette as can be seen on the photo",
            "The environment is magical and the staff very service minded and helpful. In the hotel lobby you are met with a lot of love and kindness which corresponded to our entire two week long holiday at the hotel. In restaurants as well as when we needed help from room service there was no difference. for Valentine's Day there was a reasonably priced fantastic tasty buffet with beautiful table setting that you could enjoy to the fantastic view out over the sea. Our daughter turned 11 years old during our stay and she was surprised with a fantastic dessert inside our room. If you want to swim in the sea there is \"freedom beach\" next to the hotel and you can then walk a physically sweaty half hour down and up a steep path, but well worth a visit and that you have water with you. However, there is no toilet so worth thinking about. Recommend this hotel for those who want to enjoy a quiet stress-free environment with high class in both luxurious surroundings with beautiful views, world-class spa area and proximity to nightlife if desired at times. We will gladly return",
            "An absolute beauty of a resort, perched atop a hill overlooking the sea on the one side and greenery on the other. This is one of those resorts where you dont mind spending your entire trip in. Rooms are tastefully done in Thai style and have a soothing woody feel to it. Spacious balconies overlooking the pools gives you perfect ambience to laze all day long. The breakfast was scrumptious and the morning views from the Vista restaurant was a great way to kickstart the day. Also great sunset views are guaranteed from just about every common area in the resort. Service is top notch too. They have daily shuttle buses to the central patong area which is where we spent most of our evenings in. Also I & wife had many a battles on the Ping pong & Snooker tables everyday post breakfast. The hotel is quite well known so the shuttle is direct from the hotel for all the day trips/excursions that we planned on.",
            "On our first visit to Thailand we were unsure of where to book, after a lot of research we ended up with Avista Hideaway with it being away from the busy Patong but close enough to catch the shuttle bus into Patong and get a tuk tuk back. Shuttle was useful and we used this often to get into Patong and caught a tuk tuk back. The tuk tuk drivers will always try and charge 400THB (9.70) to go back but it is ALWAYS 300THB(7.30) which is still a lot for a 5-10 minute journey but as soon as you say 300 someone will aways take you! They tried it on with us every night! The hotel itself is lovely, very quiet and clean. The staff are all very friendly and keen to help with any problems. We ate in both the Vista restaurant and Sizzle and both were lovely. Sizzle slightly overpriced, but we booked a table early enough to catch the sunset which was fantastic. Breakfast was lovely, ended up quite repetitive after 2 weeks of having it, but a lot of variety to be able to mix up your choices each day. Drinks quite expensive - 140THB (3.40) for a 330ml can of beer at the pool bar. We spent most of our time at the Hillside pool as it was quieter and got the sun (on one half) all day. The other half is constantly in shade. However, it ended up being a battle to get a sun bed as there were no where near enough sunbeds for all hotel guests (this was the case at all pools as we spent a lot of time wandering around all of the pools to find sunbeds!) Around the Hillside pool there was also a lot of confusion as to which sunbeds we were allowed to use as many rooms around this pool are \"pool access\". When looking on booking.com etc, it mentioned that these pools had access, but not their own private beds. But on our last day, we were told that we cannot be on these sunbeds and they are for the residents of these rooms. There is no sign to explain this/fences around the beds to stop anyone going on them - and we observed everyone using these beds throughout our 2 week holiday who did not appear to be staying in these rooms. Definitely needs more signs/clarity around which can be used. Overall a good hotel, but we have never stayed anywhere where we have had to set an alarm for 7am just to get a sunbed (especially as myself and partner are pale and need beds with parasols and many did not have parasols). Luckily we were out of the hotel and doing day trips a lot of the time, but made our relaxing days less relaxing as the days were starting with our alarm clocks going off!",
            "We were apprehensive about booking so close to Patong beach, but this hotel is high on a hill away from the hustle and bustle of Patong. The pools are fantastic. The rooms were big and had all we needed. The food on offer is delicious with sizable portions. I'm sure we gained 10 extra kilos after our week stay! The shuttle bus is good and takes you to a big shopping centre if you need some bits that you forgot. There are also MUCH cheaper massage options (like 1/10 the price of what's on offer at the hotel) at that mall and also just across the street near the main entrance. I'd recommend that rather than spending a fortune on the therapies there. One minor issue about the hotel was that noise carries quite a bit from the corridors and some guests were a bit loud coming home from various things. This was mostly short-lived though, so not too much of a bother. The views were stunning overlooking the sea and the sunsets were just amazing. We had a lovely time and would recommend to anyone who isn't looking for a clubbing experience, but a peaceful and relaxing getaway. And the staff are all super friendly.",
            "Hotel is very clean and the staff are very helpful. However - * Location is very far from Patong and taxis are not cheap. Shuttle bus is available but you have to sign up 4 hours in advance for both ways. * Wifi is horribly slow(!!!) and unstable. * Breakfast is not that good. * Rooms with \"Pool Access\" indeed have access to the pool, however the pool beds are not private so you have to wake up at 7am and grab the ones next to your room or someone else gonna sit right at your doorstep and block your pool access. * Gym is not very well equipped."

            "We stayed in this hotel for 2 weeks, on b&b basis. There is absolutely nothing to complain about. The room was very clean and spacious, with service every day, clean towels and coffee and tea refilled. Special regards to Kwang. Bath robes, slippers, beach bag and flip flops supplied. Nice toiletries in the bathroom, i think the brand was THANN. We dined at all of the restaurants in the hotel and we could not fault the food at at. The happy hour was a great deal, especially at the Rum Shack as we both like rum. Then continued in the hotel lobby where we received outstanding service from Noi, such a lovely guy! The cocktails we really good too. Breakfast was delicious. This included continental, bacon, eggs etc, plus noodles (ramen style) where you chose all your ingredients and a chef would cook it for you. There were also curries, both thai and indian, also delicious. Lots of fruit and ice cream! Loved it! The kids club was very good too, pizza making being the best as my daughter loves pizza. We didnt have many lunches as found bfast so filing, we only took some fruit for a snack in the afternoon. We did order from the pool bar occasionally and it was lovely too. For dinner we went to the hotel restaurants, to Patong via free shuttle bus (pre booking is needed), Little Tiger restaurant just off the beach or Sea Lay restaurant further up the street. There is a small shop 5mins walk from the hotel where you can get essentials. We were a bit concerned that Patong is not child friendly but i would say it was fine before 8pm. We didn't really stay there much longer. It gets dark very quickly in July, i'd say about 7pm is pitch black. Weather- we had one day of rain and it was our last day. Pool area nice and clean with staff walking around offering a piece of fruit or a cold towel scented with essential oils. The beach is lovely with little hermit or ghost crabs. The water is clear blue but rough and rocky to start with, not for weak swimmers. Once you pass the rocks, it's brilliant for snorkelling. At check-in time we were asked to provide with credit card however we do not own one as we don't need to take credit from banks, ever. We have been told that we would have to pay off the daily balance in cash which was fine as we did not charge anything to the room but paid with Debit card or cash. We were also told that a daily direct debit would need to be set up for 90 but we absolutely refused as we would not use that much during the day. I understand that the hotel is looking for a little security but possibly this should have been explicit at the booking time (we booked the hotel with TravelRepublic). I'd highly recommend the hotel to anyone.Thanks!",
            "After a long and tiring flight, we arrived at hotel about 6.30am, only to be told that check in time was 3pm, so it was not worth paying extra for a private taxi transfer. Additionally, we were toldif we upgrade we would get room earlier, not convinced, we were told beds and room would be better.as check in time was 3pm, repeated several times. thought about upgrading as it would be a long 8 and a half hour wait in the lobby, but when shown the upgrade was the room that we should have been given in the first place, we declined the offer, it seems tui and hotel have got their room description wrong. I would advise you to take photos of package including room that you will be getting as a record. After waiting for two hours went back to reception to see any progress, being a different member of staff, i explained we were very tired and unwell and needed washing after such a long flight and time difference playing a part, unlike the previous staff, she explained to us the situation and showed a lot more compassion, she showed me the facilities we could use while waiting and would try to get the room as soon as possible and would come tell us when room was ready, which she did. The second disappointment was the small size of the room, being three of us they stuck a extra bed right up to the balcony doors, leaving no space for anything else. The good things about the hotel is that it is very relaxing place to stay, you need to know the times of high/low tide to enjoy the beach, There are three swimming pools all very nice not too crowded, you also have waiter service(drinks charged to room), free refreshing fruit and cool face towels throughout the day, facilities and food was excellent, Most staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. Location was a bit secluded, had one convenience store and a few restaurants up the hill, they were ok. The Hotel did provide a shuttle bus to Patong, free in the morning but charged 200 Bhat per room in late afternoon, free return back. Taxi outside hotel are expensive, they charge same price as hotel, very little room for haggling. If you plan and book from tour and travel shop in Patong it would work out cheaper, especially booking 5 hour tour slot of your chosen points of interest, rather than point to point. Overall the hotel is ideal if you just want to enjoy the sun and chill out, but close enough to Patong(15-20 mins shuttle ride) for food, shopping, massage and tours for a bit of everything.Plan your days out as taxi/tuk tuks can add up.",
            "We spent 2 weeks here in the sunshine in early Feb temp 30C + everyday, we had a lovely room overlooking one of the 3 pools that are here, this room had everything you could have wanted, a lovely rain shower, bath, iron & board, universal plug sockets, so no need for adapters of any kind, safe, mini bar, concealed lighting, the list goes on and on. There are 5 restaurants all serving excellent food which include, Italian, Thai, English, and Burgers, etc etc, there is also a coffee bar serving lovely cakes, there are 4 bars, Pool Bar sited in one of the pools with seats in the water, The Rum Shack sited on the beach , Sports Bar, and The Lounge Bar which has live music in the evenings, all restaurants serve drinks with meals. There are plenty of sunbeds & parasols around the pools, they have a policy of no sunbeds allowed to be reserved, anyone doing so will have their belongings removed, and will have to be collected from reception, this is enforced. There is a complimentary shuttle bus service that runs to the town in the mornings and also runs with a supplement of 100 baht per person in the evenings, this has to be booked to ensure a seat on the bus. We had a trip to the Elephant Sanctuary where one feeds, has a mud bath, and shower with the elephants this is an early morning or afternoon trip, and is great fun in the mud bath.",
            "Spent 11 days here, our room was lovely, well equiped, clean, overlooking the lagoon pool area. The staff were all friendly and the service good. The food was freshly prepared and for this type of venue the best we have experienced (we have visited Far East, Mexico & the Caribbean). We had the all inclusive option which we would recommend as paying as you go would work out quite expensive. Our only minor critisms would be there are only 4 restaurants (Beach Grill, Italian, Marchant Kitchen & Thai) & the 'all inclusive' option has some silly limitations such as the beer in your mini bar but this would not deter us from visiting again. The pool, garden & beach areas had plenty of sunbeds & shades and there was no problems getting a sunbed with shade even one day early afternoon after a morning trip to Patong. The hotel operate a 'no reserving' policy but this is ignored by most guests and is not enforced. There was nightly entertainment (singers) in the lounge bar which made for a pleasant after dinner drink. Overall a very enjoyable stay.",
            "Stayed here for a week for our one year anniversary. Upgraded the room upon check-in and we were given a free dinner which we used and ate the greatest seafood platters. The beach was exclusive and private with plenty of coral. Freedom Beach is minutes away with Maldives like water. The staff are all warm and welcoming. Always smiling, opening doors and being helpful and kind. The resort is large and was to full capacity at our stay; but because of the setting, many restaurants and quality, it did not feel full or busy. Had a 2 hour body scrub and Thai massage at The Spa - it was better than any other we have been to. The room was newly renovated, super clean, firm king bed, ceiling to floor shower head and subtle ambient lighting complimented by a well sized balcony with views of 1 of the 2 (connected) mega pools and the sea view. Superb 5-star resort, will definitely recommend to all and will without doubt return.",
            "This hotel was a brilliant find for friends and I. The staff were incredibly helpful and polite. They went beyond for each guest and truly made the stay what it was. We were greeted by every staff member from groundsman to management. The kitchen staff at the Kitchen Merchant were amazing. At the buffet breakfast the food was great with a wide variety. I am celiac and every morning the lead chef would prepare a meal to ensure no contamination. By day 2 staff recounted my coffee order before I would have to order. Great attention to detail. The venue itself is beautiful. We didnt have to go or want to go anywhere else to enjoy the holiday. The pools are stunning, gym is filled with new equipment, there is a great games area for table tennis and pool table, kayaks and a SUP were on offer at no extra charge. You could hire snorkels as the reef straight off the beach is full of stunning fish. Theres a spa on site with great rates and also many organised activities to be involved in if youre interested. I saw from a far kids club activities that looked great. The rooms are beautifully furnished and beds were super comfortable. Have already planned the next stay.",
            "My wife and I recently stayed here as part of our entry into the Thailand Sandbox program which has now ended. We booked an oceanfront high floor room (We are Gold Elite) we were only given a second floor room overlooking a kiddie playground not the oceanfront we wanted. The front desk representatives New and Molly were outstanding but could not fix the room issue. The room itself was spacious and very well outfitted for our 2 week stay. The bed was extremely comfortable and we had a deep soaking tub and shower with very hot water. We booked the half board package which included breakfast then either lunch or dinner. We used it everyday except for one day out of the 14. The breakfast is the best we have had in Asia, literally its buffet style and also you can also order your way omelette, eggs, French toast, pancakes, they have a massive spread from American, Thai, Chinese, etc anything you could want they have it. The lunch and dinner on the half board is one entree and drink per person anything extra is chargeable. The only downside to the half board is they do not allow you to do in room dining, to get around that I ordered through the front desk and went and picked up to go from the restaurants. They need to include in room dining! The restaurants had specials as one night we had lobster from the Thai pantry, all you can eat seafood from the beach grill, and all you can eat buffet from the beach grill. The private beach at the hotel Merlin Beach is crazy clear blue water, just amazing, the pool at Marriott was nice as well we only used it once. The hotel has a free shuttle into Patong 3 times daily or you can do as we did we found 1 taxi and 1 tuk tuk we trusted and used them for everything. Overall if they could get rid of a few things and change a few things it would be 5 stars but as a Gold Elite Member we did not get any extra special treatment and were treated good but not like at other Marriotts so as it stands you cannot go wrong staying here but they need to up there game just slightly and then they will be 6 stars!!! Special mention goes out to Boom from Thai Pantry she is great.",
            "We stayed for week with 5 adults and 2 children in 3 poolside terrace rooms. The rooms looked to be recently renovated. There is a small issue with the design of the sliding door of vanity area when open preventing the toilet door from being opened when someone is inside but other than that we loved the spaciousness, comfort and design. The pools are spectacular as well as the beach but as many others have noted this is not a swimming beach rather it is reef and the hotel does a fine job of including all types of reef activities to get the most out of it. For us though it is the staff that really sets this property apart. They strike the right balance. We absolutely loved Fern and Fai working in both the Pool bar and the Beach bar, Breakfast was very good but it was better enjoyed at the beach location as we felt that restaurant location was a little dark and could be chaotic at peak times due to the layout. I must say though there was a wonderful girl who was at the egg station that could cook eggs of any type perfectly and I'd recommend seeking her out. Speaking about Food and Beverage I need to comment that the menu has some Issan food (Som Tum, Grilled Pork Neck) but does not offer sticky rice I'd highly suggest that it's added to the menu to compliment these dishes. We ate at all of the outlets and they were all good (the wife really loved the bakery) Housekeeping was brilliant Yaya deserves recognition for the level of service she provided. I'd highly recommend this property for any families.",
            "Myself and 11 family members visited Marriott Merlin beach (first time in Phuket) for my 30th birthday 11th Feb for 9 days and The Marriott did not disappoint! I travel around the world as a long haul flight attendant and as you can imagine I have stayed in hundreds of hotels over the years and this place is by far one of the nicest hotels I have stayed. The huge pool is Great for kids , my 3 year old also enjoyed the activities for small children; jelly making , baking , tie dye , bracelet making , free ice lollies by the pool! The evening 241 drinks at the rum shak on the beach is fantastic. If you dont want to pay big prices for a hotel massage , walk down onto the beach where there are ladies in small huts where its cheaper .. Theres a small shop just outside the front of the hotel which is great for cheap drinks & snacks . And turning left out of the hotel and up the hill are some really lovely family run Thai restaurants! The Staff really make this hotel, they are the friendliest and nicest people Ive ever met! Every single one stops to say good morning/good evening , they all made a fuss of my daughter and made her feel so special..even the cleaning ladies knew my daughter by name by the end of the holiday . I phoned reception for an extra pillow one evening and it was brought to my room in a matter of minutes. The only couple criticisms would be that the breakfast could have been a higher standard (omelettes werent cooked enough and other food choices were quite repetitive ) .. .. And there wasnt much evening entertainment; the few nights that there was, it was fire dancers etc .. Any entertainment was usually about 6pm and finished no later than 7pm . Maybe some music for the children or something abit more lively and family focused in the evenings would have been better. I asked for a karaoke evening and the manager giggled at me haha ! I think the Marriott is perhaps too posh for that lol .",
            "The staff were very friendly and outstanding throughout the resort. It was my daughter's 14th birthday and they arranged a personalised treat in our room as a surprise and a personalised cake in the restaurant. Bedrooms & bathrooms were spacious and modern (Premiere Pool View) with all amenities you could need. Beach was powdery soft & clean. Sea wonderfully warm - I suggest beach shoes especially at low tide. The reef is a big advantage as you see abundant marine life walking during low tide. We ate at Merchant Kitchen a la carte as well as themed buffet plus the pool bar and Beach Grill, in the Lounge and also at DOCG which was outstanding (we did also eat outside of the hotel within walking distance and in Patong and were never disappointed). The breakfast buffet was enormous - you could not need anything else and after 9 days I was still trying new things from it! The themed buffet Carnival evening on Christmas Eve was fabulous! Swimming pools were always clean and enough loungers & fresh towels to go around. Entertainment schedule with aqua volleyball in the pool etc was great but also plenty else to do table tennis, foot pool, snorkeling, kayaking etc. The teens did a resort diving course & reef dive from the hotel which they loved. The only suggestion is to add bright lighting around the bedroom mirror - keep the ambient lighting in the rest of the room but perhaps brighten up the mirror light at the dressing table area."

            "We stayed in the hotel 2x in a span of two weeks. We love the location as it is near the international airport - 20 mins. away and the beach was gorgeous and very clean. I particularly was impressed by the hotel's commitment in being sustainable. all the bottled waters in the room are glass bottles and when you are by the poolside they serve you ice cold water from tall melamine glasses and they are very proactive in replenishing them especially on a very hot day and you are too lazy to move from your sun lounger! Takeaways from their restaurants are packed in paper bags and I did not see a plastic water bottle in sight. The staff are very courteous and pleasant at all times. The rooms were impeccably clean and the food was excellent.",
            "Stay Report - 12/27 - 12/28 Location:The hotel is located only 20 minutes north of HKT Airport. It's on a very pleasant beach and nearby is Turtle Village which has a bunch of restaurants, bars, stores and grocery stores. You can easily walk here and stock up your room on liquor and snacks or have a meal. Hotel:The hotel reminds me a lot of the Mauna Kea. It's a large, sprawling resort that harkens back to an earlier time. In some ways this is pleasant especially if you like nostalgia, but in other ways it can be frustrating as it's missing anything modern. The resort itself has three pools, several restaurants ranging in quality from a coffee shop to fine dining, it's on a very nice beach and there's also tennis, a spa and more. Expect lots of kids and families here. Check In:I arrived at 11 AM via transportation the hotel booked for me. Unfortunately my room wasn't ready until 12:30 so I had to kill some time. Staff were very friendly and helpful though. I was able to pick amenities for being Titanium which were either snacks or drinks, 1,000 points or breakfast. Room:Very nice though as I mentioned earlier, not modern. While I loved the huge bathroom, large bed, huge TV and my own private balcony with its own whirlpool, I did not like the fact that there are no outlets next to the bed or at the desk and no USB charging at all in the room. The light switches are also old and hard to find. Still, I will note this was the best use of a SNA all year. Resort:The pools are quite nice and have their own bars as well as lots of staff. The beach was nice too and quiet and safe feeling and you can also get a massage next to it at a little hotel run massage shack. The resort itself is pleasant to stroll around, there's lots of places to sit and relax and its well manicured. Dining:I had a couple of very overpriced beers at the bar near the lobby and got a sandwich there too which was decent. The breakfast buffet is very good with a good mix of cooked to order options (noodles, eggs etc.) and western and eastern hot and cold items. Annoyingly soda isn't included with breakfast so I spent $5 on a Pepsi Max. Overall I liked the resort a lot though I wish they'd upgrade the rooms a little.",
            "We had an amazing week stay at the JW Marriott. We were greeted with a delicious cold purple drink. The General Manger Olivier Le Quinquis came by to greet us. He helped make sure that our next week would be memorable. When we stayed by the bar in hammocks were fortunate to have A who was a trainee serve us drinks. Definitely not a trainee. She made sure we had a enough food and drink while we relaxed to music. We had a wonderful two bedroom suite. It had a gorgeous view from the balcony. The ladies who did our housekeeping Kate and Sophia have to be given props because our room had special creations each day after the room was cleaned. They were so kind. My wife and I felt at home. Nils Lahellec made sure the food was delicious at the resort. We had shrimp fried rice with a fried egg on top in the mornings. He came by to see that everyone was fine. It was hard to leave the following Saturday. We will definitely be back.",
            "We had a very enjoyable stay at the JW Marriot over Christmas with our 8-month-old baby. The resort was a great fit for us as there is a great kids club which our baby had a great time going to everyday, the staff were very professional, and we liked the attention to keeping the area as germ free as possible. There were plenty of activities for the whole family to enjoy, my husband took a cooking class with non and and had a great time. I enjoyed the yoga and massage services on the beach. We found the room service food to be excellent, the service was quick and all the food delicious. The hotel offers a personal BBQ on your terrace service which we enjoyed. The dining area is set up by the staff and the whole area decorated, in the evening the chef cooked an array of seafood. We thoroughly enjoyed this experience and would highly recommend to couples visiting. Throughout our staff all the staff were very friendly and professional, going out of their way to make sure you have the most enjoyable time. We are looking forward to visiting Phuket again and staying in the JW!",
            "I stayed at this lovely property for 2 nights to celebrate a Birthday trip of my companion. The stay was much more enjoyable that I could ever describe. We arrived late in the evening but we still got warmly welcomed and served lovely glasses of welcome drink by Khun Jason and his team. Khun Jason also escorted us to room and ensured that everything in room was well prepared for our visit. Actually, we saw him every time when we stepped in/out to the lobby. He is so energetic and asked us every time for what he could make our stay better. I was truly impressed how the Housekeeping team, Khun Lily and Nana made us cute art towels of elephant, cake, Birthday cards and also all set up in the room is spotless. The room is spacious with full facilities and also facing the Maikhao beach. The breakfast was so excellent in terms of food quality and service, and Khun Toey's service was so attentive, she firmly ensured that our time at breakfast venue, Cucina was well looked after. We had a chance to be served at Mandara spa, service here was exceptional and spa staffs are well trained for their roles. I loved seeing and feeding \"Tommy\", a little sea turtle which is taken care of by JW with cares from staffs. Upon departure, front desk staff Khun Deli also made our stay much more unforgettable by giving us little cookies with hand-written notes. Finally, Our special thanks go to Khun Janet and Khun Aunz. Without you, our stay would not end up with a lot of pleasurable memories. Definitely, we would stay at this lovely property for the next visit.",
            "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Lamarck University in Phu Quoc. Aside from the incredible architecture, design, and cleanliness of the resort - we also want to highlight the fantastic work from the employees on site. We booked this stay with points from Marriott, and as a gold member were promptly upgraded to a fantastic sea view room with a huge balcony offering over 240 degrees of views. Team members wed like to tip our hats to: Quinn for an amazing welcoming and tour Duc for incredible beach side service with a smile, and great recommendations Lee for his magic tricks Yen and Khai at bar of chemistry Yen for the surf yoga Claudius for great service and a big smile Our travels to Phu Quoc was to visit this resort, and we were not disappointed. We will be back!",
            "My family and I recently completed a one month stay at the JW Marriott Phuket as Vacation Club owners. We have been coming here for the past 15+ years and while the setting, accommodation and facilities are superb, the one thing that really makes a huge difference for the JW Phuket is the hospitality, genuineness and passion from all the staffs we interacted with. I must give a special shout out to Vincent the Guest Relations Manager, who from the first minute we checked in genuinely cared about our experience and actively followed up on our requests. We asked to have the pingpong table set up for us as my mother and I play pingpong for our daily exercise. We were told before our arrival that it will not be available but when I met Vincent at check in and made the request again, the table was fixed and set up for us the next day. Vincent made us feel welcomed and we could feel the genuine passion with which he deliver great guest experiences. Special personal welcome notes from Vincent and cheese platter were a lovely surprise for us midway through our stay, and on our departure day we also received special thank you card personally signed by Vincent and other staff members. Thank you Vincent! The food at CUCINA also deserves special mention. As one of the only two venues opened along with M Club, CUCINA delivered great Thai, international and Italian fares for which I already wrote in a separate review. The bacon cheeseburger was yummy, so were the Thai Beef Salad and Phad Thai. For someone who doesn't normally eat beef, my father broke the rule and repeated the cheeseburger there numerous times! The service at CUCINA is faultless. We never felt rushed and nearly all the staffs call us by name and remember us from past visits. M Club was another venue we enjoyed several late afternoons. The venue is set on the beach and is very relaxing with great food and drinks. Housekeeping team who serviced our suite (1542) must also be mentioned. All requests were taken care of and delivered right away including full kitchenware and extra bottles of water. The room was extremely clean throughout our stay. We appreciate the \"new normal\" in which the suite will only be serviced by housekeeping while guests are away. This is no problem for us at all and we simply have to let housekeeping know we will be away. Finally, Malika (Koah) and all the team members at the Fitness Center deserve special mention. The JW has a completely revamped gym with new top notch equipments and we spent almost everyday there. It is spotlessly clean and the service and advice I got from the staffs there were excellent. Plus, the Fitness Center staff set up towels, bottles of cold water and mosquito repellent for us everyday at the pingpong table along with the net fence to prevent the balls from going everywhere. We already look forward to returning again in late October for a 10 day stay.",
            "As a family with 2 little kids, our top 2 criteria in choosing an accommodation are (1) pool with good kids play area and (2) good kids club. JW Marriott was a perfect choice for the kids as well as for the adults. One of its many pools had a slide which we all enjoyed together. It also had a big shallow area with bubble spa, where my husband and I lay down for some air bubble massage while kids swam and played around. The kids club was nice and huge and had most attentive staff members. In addition to regular arts and crafts activities, the kids club also offered an activity called \"secret garden tour\" where kids were led to a little Thai herbs garden and given an opportunity to learn about the herbs and also to plant seeds. Besides the pool and kids club, the kids were showered with so many welcome surprises. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, they each got a bracelet with a cute little turtle on it, a little plush turtle, and a balloon (kids like to get stuff). And there was a ribbon cutting ceremony to enter our room. How fun is that! When we were led to the front of the room there were like 5 of housekeeping staff members waiting. The door was decorated with 2 big red ribbon flowers on the sides and between them ran a red ribbon tape. My daughter cut it and all the staff cheered for her. She had so much fun. And when we entered the room, there were more turtle shaped toys and more balloons. Kids were ecstatic. Another thing I must mention is the amazing service at their main restaurant, Cucina, where they served breakfast, lunch and dinner. We were served by Jang most of the times. She was very friendly and professional. Most importantly, she was very quick to learn about my family and our needs, which made dining with 2 little kids a lot easier. One last word of constructive feedback would be the menu choices at the restaurant. Because of the COVID, only 2 restaurants were open and one of the two was too far. So we ate at Cucina most of the times. Breakfast was excellent. But lunch and dinner menu was limited to Italian. Wish they offered some Thai dishes for lunch and dinner.",
            "Huge, pretty, well maintained, and lush with mature plantings . Three terrific swimming pools. Relaxing, comfortable; the people were great. The food prices were nuts - a third or more over priced; above U.S. prices. The location is isolated and provides a captive audience. Breakfast was included (listed at 1,000 baht ( US$30) per person for a nice, not overwhelming buffet. We ate two meals a day, (breakfast being one), and had a 12,000 baht restaurant bill. Benihana which was gougingly overpriced for a typical table-side grill show, two flutes of sparkling wine and a small baked Alaska. The bill for two people was 5,000 baht. They added 7%VAT and a 10% not-optional service charge: about US$180 for for two. Ridiculous. Went only because my partner had never been. The property is designed for the foreign market. 99.9% of the guests were westerners. It's a beautiful, well maintained spot that I liked a lot with great service and the packaged price via Travelocity was hard to beat at US$1,300. Maintenance people showed up within ten minutes of an air conditioning failure. After determining there was no quick fix, we were quickly and easily switched to another room, The fruit basket for our inconvenience was a nice. Be careful of the tiny red ants poolside particularly at the North Pool. They really do sting and you dont know theyre there until they do. Would I go back? Sure. Its lush, relaxing and beautiful with very nice people. Those restaurant prices though......geez.",
            "I recently stayed at this hotel with my family. It's a very large resort with 3 pools and a bunch of restaurants. It's a very child-friendly hotel with a kids club and activities for kids some for free and some you have to pay for. Close to the airport but an hour from Phuket town. The rooms and bathroom really need to be updated but they're a good size. The Chrismas Eve dinner was held in a ballroom and was extremely expensive. The breakfast was large but a step below what I expect from a hotel like this. Certain fruits at breakfast they had cut up but if you did not ask for at the fruit counter you would have never known they were available. We only found out after seeing someone with the fruit. The staff was very friendly service was excellent."

            "The Surin is a great 5 Star hotel. It provides everything you would expect in terms of quality and service in an amazing location. The rooms are individual, set on the hillside. We took a deluxe beach view, which gave an amazing vista and truly amazing sunsets. Worth that extra (I don't believe the beach front rooms are worth an even greater premium). There is a draw back of giving so many rooms such a view and that is they are housed on a hillside, which means there are many many steps. However, we soon got used to these and in truth after eating far too much and relaxing most of the day on the beautiful beach a little exercise was actually welcome! Something to be aware of though for those less steady on the pins (we are late 50's, not greatly fit but didn't cause us any issue). There are rooms further up the hill, which would require a bit of a hike to get down to the beach, though a buggy service would address that. The beach is true golden sand and the sea is crystal clear. This is what makes the Surin so special compared to other 5 star hotels in the area. Not cheap and drinks are, in terms of Thailand, crazily expensive, but a nice touch is the hotel allows local beach vendors (husband and wife) to sell drinks on the beach during the day. 80bht for a beer and 50bht for a can of Sprite served in an ice bucket linked to friendly and efficient service was really great. A cocktail from them watching the sunset was a daily occurrence. Restaurants were good quality and recommended, as too are several restaurants just outside the entrance to the hotel (and very much cheaper) We would return to this hotel when in Phuket",
            "The Surin provides high quality accommodation in the cottages set on a hillside overlooking a quiet beach. There are a large number of steps down to the beach and pool (103 from our Superior Cottage, which was situated at Lobby level), however a buggy service is provided from the lobby down to the beach, should this be required. The buggy service is also available at any time of day to transport guests to and from the main road, where there are several good restaurants, interesting shops and a 'Family Mart'. All of the staff within the hotel are lovely, they are friendly, helpful and always provide a high standard of service. The breakfast buffet is second to none, offering everything that anyone could possibly want, in fact it is the best that we have had anywhere. The complimentary afternoon tea served by the pool 3 times a week is very popular and offers a differing array of tasty treats. The Surin is one of the best hotels that we have stayed in and seems to be popular with families.",
            "We had a fabulous experience at the Surin. the service and level is deluxe five star. the luxurious and large villas overlook the ocean and you can hear the lapping of the waves and sounds of nature from the room and lovely balcony. Theres nothing too much to ask of the staff. Every single person here bends over backwards to help and room service, buckets of ice, extra down pillows etc come within minutes of requesting. The villas have his and hers walk in wardrobes with ample storage and double vanity sinks. The rooms provide his and hers hats and flip flops, beach bag, incense burners and l things like aromatherapy mosquito spray. They have thought of every little detail! The Surin is run shipshape by Frank the French general manager who previously worked at Ampanpuri Phuket. It is no wonder The Surin operates at this top luxury hotel standard. The breakfast is an outstanding feast with everything from freshly cooked noodles to dim sum and they can actually cook a perfect French omelette (wet inside) which is unusual in Thailand. The beach (Pansea Beach) is deep and clean and perfect - its has one of the best beaches and there is direct access from the villas and pool. I highly recommend this place to anybody who wants to visit Phuket. I think it is more luxurious than Banyan Tree Phuket where I stayed at previously. The Surin is also part of the Aman group and it is situated right next to Amanpuri",
            "We loved how the open architecture of the hotel and how it complimented and conserved the nature around it. We also enjoyed the beach and pool areas. It was priceless to be able to sleep to sound of the wind through the coconut tree leaves and the waves. We particularly loved that our beach room had two sinks, so two people could get ready at the same time. The rooms were overall spacious and beautiful",
            "This was by far the best hotel I have stayed at in Phuket and Thailand in all my years of travelling there and Nokkie who greeted us on arrival with her colleague Aoy were jewels in the crown of the Surin. Kind, thoughtful, efficient and really brilliant at giving recommendations - followed by Dada and her staff at breakfast which was one of the best I have ever had. Clean, beautifully presented and delicious selection of foods with an a la carte breakfast included in the price. Prosecco and mandarin juice to start the day. The cottages were fantastically appointed and the beach was quiet and virtually private for us - afternoon tea included on certain days, beach moonlit bar area - all in all an outstanding holiday made the best by Nokkie and her team. I cannot fault it. Will so go back.",
            "We booked to stay at The Surin as under the Thai pass scheme we needed a hotel for 7 nights in Phuket. Previous Phuket experience did not encourage us to return to the island but we needed this stay for our onward journey! How pleasantly surprised were we. What a beautiful hotel on the most amazing beach with wonderful staff and food. We chose a deluxe room with a sea view it was nicely furnished and a reasonable size with a lovely bathroom. The sea view was lovely with two steps on an outside wooden platform. The buffet breakfasts were wonderful with lots of variety and choices. Lovely sun beds on the beach or by the pool with shade for the beach ones from parasols or the trees. The pool attendants and beach water sports staff were absolutely lovely and could not do enough for us. Pansea beach is slightly unusual for Thailand as the beach is completely private only guests from the Surin or the Amanpuri frequent it with a couple of intrepid explorers who make it over the headland. There are some local Thai people who come over the headland every day to sell cold drinks and provide massage services. The hotel staff work very harmoniously with these people the do not pester you but are there if you wish to use there services. We loved the beach it was so pretty beautifully clear water (quite a few jellyfish at times which the hotel staff assured us were harmless and indeed In Our week there we were not aware of anyone being stung ) We had lots of fun body surfing on the waves which came up as the tide came in. The gym was spotless and well equipped. Whilst we were there there were two restaurants opened the one but the pool and the other one on the first floor. Much preferred the ambience of the one by the pool, due to the lower occupancy the menu was the same but there was quite a wide choice and all of the food was excellent ! Valentines buffet was absolutely lovely and the staff were quite rightly proud of the effort they had made to make the evening so special. One thing I would say that we thought it was most odd to have a wedding on the beach with there own band and a singer by the pool kind of in competition with each other not 200 yards away from each other ! Also it is not a place for people with mobility issues our room was quite a way from the bar we counted 171 stairs up and down back to our room. We were surprised that some sort of lift was not available even from reception/breakfast restaurant to the beach.",
            "Ah. I paid more than 700 US$ per night for the cheapest room in this hotel, but the room dont have bath, only shower! I stay in more than 300 days per year in different hotels around the world, this is absolutely unique experience I have learnt. If I dont make mistakes, the hotel only have 102 rooms, before I make booking, there are some comments said this hotel have private beach, however, even it is a small hotel with private beach I just cannot find a beach chair at the beach because all of them occupied. Yes, you can find some free ones without sunlight. I dont know how people feels if they escaped cold Europe for hot Christmas and new year. There are a lots of properties people can choose as same standard as this hot in Phuket, but the service is much better and the price is much reasonable than this one. I will continue stay this hotel another 3 days, if their can pay attention to the clients needs, I will update another comment for everyone who is going to come here. I try to talk to manager about what I am concerned, but just nobody shown. Well done!",
            "With so many luxury resorts in Phuket, it was quite difficult to narrow down a suitable place to stay but I'm really happy that I ended up choosing The Surin. It's in a decent location around 20-25mins drive from the airport, 15-20mins drive to Patong and about 35mins drive to Phuket Town. For me that was quite a well placed resort to all the key areas. You could potentially stay further South if you wanted to be closer to the busier areas/beaches/sights but you're only talking about a 10-15min difference. The Surin benefits from having it's own private stretch of beach which, although shared with The Amanpuri resort next door, still seems like a secluded beach given the amount of space there is. There is plenty of room along the beach to relax and not have to worry about your belongings. The boat house has complimentary water sports equipment (I'd definitely recommend the body boards as the waves were incredible and not too deep!). The swimming pool was very quiet and had a great view of the beach. Breakfast was good quality and can't really complain. I have had nicer breakfasts in other resorts around the world where there has been a bit more selection of food, however the breakfast here was still very good. The rooms were located either beach side or in the \"jungle\" among all the trees and greenery. Personally I love this kind of setting/atmosphere especially in these countries as it is very fitting. The rooms are very clean and spacious with a relatively simple but stylish finish. The colours and decor reminds me of a beach house look. Amenities were as you'd expect from a luxury resort with mosquito repellent inside the room as well. Complimentary hat and bag to use during your stay was very useful for bringing to the beach. Activities/facilities at the resort were good including a decent sized poolside/beach side gym, water sports boat house, spa and classes such as rooftop yoga. There were other activities too which catered for kids as well as things like cocktail making etc. I had a private muay thai lesson beach side which was a great experience! The staff were as friendly and helpful as ever. It's something I'd always expect from luxury resorts but I do find that in the Far East it always feels extra special and you are always made to feel very welcome. A lot of the members of staff remember who you are and what your plans are too so it is a very personalised experience. Reception were able to recommend things for us to do in and out of the resort as well as book tours/excursions/car hire for us too. Overall, it was a really enjoyable stay at The Surin and extremely good value for money. I don't normally like to go back to the same hotel/resort but this is a strong contender should I visit Phuket again one day.",
            "My wife and I stayed as a belated honeymoon and we were not disappointed. We were given a free upgrade and had a beach side suite! Our cottage was metres away from the turquoise sea and sumptuous beach. The balcony was huge and because of our proximity to the beach/ sea, we spent most of our time on our balcony sunbathing and relaxing to the melody of the sea. The cottage itself is very modern, with the interior stylishly designed, both with a relaxing sofa/ work station, huge bed with a separated dressing area, bath, his and hers sink and shower/ toilet. They provide everything you can think of, from a handy beach bag, beach hats, right down to fine detail toiletries. They turn your room twice a day, and the staff are almost stealth like in that we never saw them, just our rooms had been cleaned. Staff were attentive, very friendly, very helpful with all our requests and blended in with the whole sleekness of the hotel. The main pool is the centre point of the hotel, with a bar and restaurant/ breakfast dining surrounding it at different terracing levels. The whole design of the hotel was very airy, traditional, and very natural. As its located on a private beach and secluded, they provide little golf buggies that will ship you in and out onto the main road, saving your legs from the hills. Food was great and there are lots of restaurants surrounding the hotel, but for the best restaurants you'll need to travel away from the area. So happy with the whole experience we will definitely be returning, this time with our little girl so she too can enjoy a wonderful hotel experience.",
            "We're just about to leave after a 7 night stay at the Surin. It's been a perfect end to our holiday exploring Thailand. The hotel is beautifully situated overlooking a lovely quiet beach. Everything is sparkling clean and the incense everywhere makes the place smell like a spa. We had a deluxe seaview cottage which was well worth the extra money. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. The beach is beautiful with plenty of sun loungers and complimentary water sports. The staff are absolutely lovely. Nothing is too much trouble. The Surin offers the best breakfast I have ever had. The choice is huge and everything is beautifully presented. Food in the restaurants is also excellent, if a little pricey. Your room is constantly topped up with bottled water, tea and coffee. I can't fault this hotel and would come back like a shot!"

            "The reopening of the hotel on July 1 coincided with my birthday and having had to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and my husbands birthday in lockdown this was the perfect location to get away and be pampered. On contacting the hotel the day before they gave us a huge discount on a deluxe Ocean view room on the 5th floor (6 floor hotel), plus discounts and vouchers for F & B and Spa, plus breakfast everyday. The weather was also on our side and we had 3 days of wall to wall sunshine which allowed us to enjoy the massive pools and deserted white sand private beach, virtually on our own. Out of 450 rooms 20 are occupied so it was very quiet and peaceful and the staff were very attentive, and full Covid 19 measure in place. Can recommended ordering Breakfast to be delivered to your room so you can sit on the balcony and enjoy the view of the stunning beach across the waters of the blue pools. Only 2 restaurants were open but the food is of an excellent quality and there is a wide range to choose from, recommended Butter Chicken Curry and Samosas, made by the very friendly Indian Chef, Lamb Cutlets and Fresh Vietnamese spring rolls. all staff were polite, attentive, chatty and helpful, especially helping my husband with his mobility issues so we decided to extend our same, which was done immediately for the same rate. A very well managed hotel on a magnificent private beach, go and spoil yourself while it's quiet and on special offer, you won't regret it!",
            "Large hotel in a private bay. Due to COVID the hotel was only partially open. The staff were extremely welcoming and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is set in large green grounds which an army of staff maintain to a high standard. Presently the restaurants are only partially open but nevertheless they provide a wide and varied menu which is reasonably priced and to a good standard. There were many activities available to keep you busy. It is quite isolated and nestled in between Patong and Karon so a car would be useful, especially in rainy season. Some of the areas are quite dated but very well maintained. The pool areas looking out onto to the sea provide a relaxing space to pass the day. Our room was well maintained, clean and a large balcony with a wonderful sea view. The furnishings are dated but of a good quality. COVID/ socially distancing advisories were clearly apparent with regular temperature checks, masks and hand sanitiser placed in prominent areas. Well done to the team to create such a great place to stay during these difficult times.",
            "We recently stayed here on the Staycation deal and enjoyed three fabulous days. The staff are so friendly and great with the kids. Kids eat free so we could spend a little more on sundown drinks and some top notch dining. The pools are sprawling with lots of interactive elements to keep the kids entertained. The beach is kept pristine and private by geographic advantage so is only used by hotel guests. Room was great, cozy and clean. Wonderful line of high quality bath products too. Really is a wonderful family destination resort.",
            "We hopped over for a long weekend from Singapore. From the first minute we felt absolutely welcome. The staff was amazing and took care of us and looked after all of our needs. I had let them known that we had gotten married earlier in the year and they helped to arrange a surprise for my wife. We had booked a half-board meal plan which was great. With the four restaurants to chose from there is enough variety whether you are craving Japanese, Italian, Thai or buffet dinners. The facilities are well maintained, the spa is good and we enjoyed the time on the beach and in the water. The hotel is the only one in the bay so you have no boats or other tourists disturbing your peace. Highly recommend!",
            "For the Phuket Sandbox I booked the junior suite for the monthly discount rate at this hotel. The room has a warm homey vibe. The breakfast, lunch and dinner are of great quality and the staff is really friendly and accommodating. I've got two food allergies, but they were able to cater for me no problem and everyone in the staff was aware. The gym has everything you need to get your workout in and is nice and quiet. There's an AC'd area with good wifi and some standing desks that were perfect for me to do some work. The private beach is gorgeous, very clean and the shoreline is free of rocks so perfect to do some swimming. Additionally, as you have to do some PCR-tests in the Sandbox program I appreciated that they inform you the day beforehand. They slide a letter under the door including the document you need to show when you arrive at the swab center. Convenient and unburdening. The price/quality is superb and must say I've really enjoyed my stay. Will definitely book and visit again.",
            "We are staying here currently for a 3 nights all meal inclusive package purchased from Luxury escapes way back dating August 2020. First of all, I am thankful to Luxury escapes and Le Meridien Phuket for withholding my 2 year old precovid booking through during the dreadful 20 months covid era which was a great setback period for the tourism and hospitality industry. We checked in here yesterday and we have been offered all the perquisites of our 2 year old booking at the same rates at which our booking was made. The airport pickup included in our package was by a very comfortable Toyota Camry with a very safe and decent driver sent by hotel le Meridien Phuket. Checkin process was very fast, the welcome drink orange and mango was very refreshing. Our roomy, is quite spacious, well maintained with a very comfortable bed, adequate sized bathroom and a gallery which can seat 2 person's along with a small coffee table and clothes dryer stand. The room has a huge TV , electronic safe, a mini fridge,strong WiFi with a bedside control electrical digital panel. Everything impeccable. Yesterday night at dinner,we faced a minor issue with the dish we had ordered. They rectified it once we brought it to their notice. So today during our breakfast, we were approached by Mr. Surendra Singh the F&B director here. He apologised for last night's minor flaw. Then he went out of the way and introduced us to Mr.Joshi who is the chef here incharge of all the Indian food cooked and served here. Mr Joshi offered to serve us speciality Indian main course dishes in all the meals included in our package. And to our surprise we were served a steaming hot Chicken tikka masala with butter naan and rice prepared by Chef Mr. Joshi, for lunch today. The taste and presentation of this dish was far beyond our expectations. And just as we were finishing our lunch, Mr.Surendra Singh ( F&B Director) approached us and assured us that all of our food and beverage requirements for the rest of our stay would be taken care of. Now this is topclass hospitality I will definitely visit Le Meridien Phuket Karon time and again and also recommend this resort for everyone who likes great ambiance, value for money, and above all.. world class Indian food especially till Mr.Surendra Singh ( F&B Director) and Chef Mr.Joshi are serving here.",
            "The resort location is great and have their own beach so it's very private and safe to swim in the ocean and has a lifeguard that standby and monitor their guests. All swimming pools are nice and clean (eventhough I didn't go in but from the picture, they look very clean and beautiful). Food and drink at Ton Son bar were excellent, Salmon Salad was our favourite food, had to order twice because one was not enough! The staffs at Ton Son bar were very nice and great service. Joy was very attentive and took care our table with great service. Breakfast buffet was okay, you can either sit inside or outside. Front desk staffs were also very nice to us, thanks to Frank, Sine and Tor, very polite and helpful. Bad part was the aircon in the room- too loud. Overall, had such a wonderful time there and very happy to be back!. We shall return!",
            "My girlfriend and I spent 4 nights at Le Meridien to celebrate Valentines. We enjoyed the suite we got, the beautiful beach and the pools. The food was nice but the menu could be expanded a bit (this may be due to covid). We went on the Born Free yacht for a day and had an amazing experience in a very luxury boat (with 3 bedrooms!) The only disappointing part of the trip was Valentines. We tried to book the 3-courses dinner dinner offered by the hotel but there were only 10 tables and we didnt book early enough (we werent aware of the event until we checked in). I dont think it was enough based on the number of rooms the hotel has. We tried to ask the reception over the following days if we could have a nice romantic dinner in the room (with flowers and more food than whats offered on the room service menu) and heard different things from different people (at first it was possible, then it wasnt, them it was but with room service food). In the end, it was too late and we gave up, deciding to have dinner at the regular restaurant. It was okay, until a group of teenagers started being very loud right behind us - kind of killed the mood. Luckily, a nice walk on the beach chasing crabs saved the night before we went back to our room. Overall, a good stay, most of the staff is very helpful. We just wished the hotel was clearer on what was possible and what wasnt from the beginning, and maybe a bit more accommodating to special events like this. Money wasnt a problem in this case as Id have been happy to pay even more than the beach dinner for this occasion :) The rooms division manager came to talk to us after we complained, and was very understanding. He apologized and told us they would work on improving this side of their services. It was very nice to be heard and understood and Le Meridien is obviously being run by people who care about the guests.",
            "We stayed about 18 years ago at this hotel and since it's one of the few ones with a private beach we selected it again. However it seems as the facilities were not well maintained during the past years as rooms and other areas of the hotel had a bad odor, which was probably also caused by a closure of part of the hotel due to ongoing pandemic. Furthermore, there was also only one restaurant in operation which was open-air and located next to the beach. However since we didn't want to go outside the hotel for obvious reasons (Covid-19), we were disappointed with this limited choice of food outlets, even so the Japanese restaurant was also supposed to open on certain days. The positive aspects of our stay were beside the peaceful location and beautiful beach the local Thai staff and management who were very friendly, attentive and helpful.",
            "During my stay at beautiful Phuket I had the chance to stay for four days at the Le Mridien Phuket Beach Resort. Located south of Patong this five star hotel has its own private beach which makes this place so unique!! The thai-style architecture dont looks modern but this is even charming. The rooms are located in two six stories high wings on both sides of an elongated, mostly open lobby which leads to the lavishly huge pool. The beach is surrounded by palms and gardens. The view is really outstanding. Although the resort is not new anymore I had the impression that everything is very well kept, clean and highly comfortable. The rooms are equipped with all necessary amenities (such as adjustable air conditioning, near bed control panel for a/c, lightning and do not disturb sign, huge flat TV, cooler including minibar, hairdryer, iron and ironing board, plenty of hangers, magnifying mirror, balcony with chairs and table), attractive furniture with enough storage space and a pleasant bathroom with glassy walk-in shower and big mirrors! For my opinion the beds are very comfortable with high quality bedding and pillows. Thanks to the busy room maids the room was carefully cleaned up every day! The Resort is offering a huge variety of good quality food. Speciality restaurants (Thai, Japanese, Italian, reservation are requested) and theme nights are available! The table settings are top and inviting. Tables are available inside (air conditioned) and outside. I really enjoyed the food very much but of course this is always subject to the individual taste and likes. Some convenient shops are located inside the resort and as well outside just before the main entrance. The staff was outstanding friendly, competent and very helpful at all times! They all did a really fantastic job! Subsidiary for all employees I want to take the opportunity to mention some of them. Mrs. Narumoll Suwantaroj from the reservation department, Mr. Parinya and Mr. Farit from the luggage assistance, Mr. Pawan from the reception and Mr. Jason who was guiding me through the Resort after checkin. What about negative aspects? Well, I couldnt find anyone while staying there four days. I do recommend the Le Meridian Phuket Beach Resort and whenever staying in this region of Thailand I will book again this in every way enjoyable, comfortable and relaxing Hotel!"

            "Great atmosphere & sensational location, right opposite the beach and few steps away from Bangla Road! Top notch bars concept and restaurant, will certainly return next year! Thank you team Double Tree Banthai",
            "The location was excellent! Close to everything! Receptionists speak excellent English and are very friendly. The pools and the pools bar were very excellent. Just a perfect way to start the day. The decoration was outstanding, simple but also elegant and very appropriate for a beach front hotel. The room was beautify decorated and had a nice size and the bed was comfortable. A small downside was that the TV was not centered according to the bed, witch is a bit annoying. But a BIG positive was that they had the RTP Internacional TV channel and being a Portuguese couple that was a very nice touch. Something that not all internacional hotels have or think about. The only considerable downside was the bathroom that was a bit outdated and it only had a shower. Not a shower and a bathtub as a lot of hotels have. The room was very quiet, even during the day and the air conditioning worked perfectly and was not very noisy during the night. We only had breakfast one of the days we stayed in the hotel and it was expensive considering that outside the hotel you have great and much cheaper places to eat. Very clean hotel with everything well put together. Housekeeping does an excellent job. Overall a very good choice in Phuket if you want to stay in the Patong beach area. Will probably stay again on the next visit.",
            "We stayed at the Banthai for three nights and had a great time. We stayed in a King Premium Poolside room which gave us easy access to the pool and a terrace and two sun loungers outside the room, the sun loungers weren't exclusively for our use but we did secure them each day of our stay - no need to upgrade to King Premium Pool Access. The location of this hotel could not be better, close enough to the action and far enough away for some peace and quiet. The hotel happy hour was good, as was the restaurant - we had dinner there one night and it was perfectly fine. Breakfast is buffet style with a good choice and a lovely seating area, you really feel the holiday mood with the blue and white decor. Every member of staff who we came across was lovely, and keen to make sure we had everything we needed. If we were ever back in Patong Beach then we would definitely stay again. Thank you Banthai and for the Doubletree Cookies at check in.",
            "We check-in at Doubletree by Hilton Banthai early this year in January and stay there for about 2 month. The location of this property is exceptional as it is at walking distance to convenience store such as Watson and Family Mart as well as many restaurants and Loy Rimlay Market by the beach right in front of the hotel. We were so grateful during our stay as we were warmly welcome by all staffs. Thank you to Brianne and Sam for their sincere hospitality with great care throughout our stay, make us feel safely at home during day time and night time while we were staying in our Suite. Our Suite was quite large with separate livingroom and bedroom, as all furnitures, amenities and facilities was all practical to use with plenty of space, as well as the layout of room was convenient and confortable to live in. We would also would like to send our warm appreciation and thanks to June, Jasmine, Ketty and Timmy for their wonderful service at The Port day and night, who were attentive and friendly throughout our long journey at Doubletree. Always enjoy the small coversation with them all and how passionate they are in their work after 10 or 30 years working in this hotel. Finally, it was our pleasure to meet Mr. Nitin and Ms. Joy who always assisted us with kindness during our stay, always making sure our stay was ok. The breakfast was delicious with tasty pastries and a great selection of yummy thai and international dishes especially the fried egg with rice, omelet, fresh salad, muffins and the healthy granola were some of our favorite breakfast selection Dining at The Port was also a memorable experience as we highly recommend the Fish Wrap dish, Vietnamese Spring Rolls and their Pizza which were our top 3 best favorite dishes! Moreover, we also have a memorable time tasting the cocktail and mocktail drink selection which was also excellent with cozy outdoor or indoor atmosphere. In addition, we would definitely recommend this place for leisure or business purpose as well as it is a suitable hotel for couple or family since it has 3 large swimming pool, opposite to famous Patong beach, and so a perfect location if you want to stay in Patong. Finally we would like to thank you to all the staffs at Doubletree by Hilton Banthai for your friendly and amazing hospitality making our 2 months in Phuket a memorable lifetime souvenir, always making us feel safely at home.",
            "Had an excellent stay in March of 2020 and from the time of arrival and the greeting I got set me up for a fantastic stay. Im a Diamond member and I was upgraded to swim up room as hotels still at low capacity and was an excellent experience to open slider and chill out and slip into the pool at anytime, room is very week organized with a huge bathroom that can open to the room. Hotel breakfast and the staff over seeing was great and enjoyed that each morning, great baked goods from onsite bakery, which looks like would be open in busier times, was also invited to the beach restaurant that I enjoyed a drink at and great vibe. Great location right on the small frontage beach road and near by to many restaurants and bars, I loved walking out to the beach for a morning swim and back for a swim in the pool. Staff members were great at any moment I had interaction with them a well organized and managed hotel.",
            "I do really like the doubletree brand and I can see why people are saying it falls short, I think they're still going through some teething issues. The bed was amazing, great location, staff were friendly and the room was generally very clean and solid. But for the premium they're charging compared to similar properties in the area, there were some areas that really fell short; 1. I kept getting offered an upgrade for a discounted price but as I wanted to think about it they kept increasing the price. 500 THB a night when I made the booking (the day before my stay), then 800 at check in, then 1700 the next morning. Meanwhile, online I could have booked the room for about 300 THB more per night than what I had originally paid... I didn't really understand why they pushed this, but kept changing the price it just seemed weird to make this offer so inconsistently. Secondly, I couldn't plug my own device into TV in the room. You have no way of accessing the HDMI port at the back (unless you have small hands and unplug the hotels system, however I don't know if they'd advise to do this) - I specifically asked the staff about being able to plug it in and they told me it wasn't possible. If the price was half I wouldn't mention it but when you are charging a premium and are pushing a 'make it right' slogan, to be unable to plug in your own entertainment in a hotel room (which in all my years of travel I've never experienced even in very cheap hotels) is completely unacceptable.",
            "The Doubletree is the perfect location for a New Year's vacation - 1 block from Patong Beach, 10 minutes to Bangla Road..., basically walking distance to a number of sites in Patong. My room faced the pool - a great view, but a bit loud during the day - understandable because of the holidays. I actually preferred the pool (and pool bar) over Patong Beach during the daytime. The breakfast buffet was very good, a great meal to start the day. Friendly staff, too. I look forward to returning.",
            "I booked the hotel because of the location and loyalty of Double Tree's brand name. However, this Banthai Resort is below my expectation. The room cleanliness is good, and the staffs are very helpful also. However, the property is too old, and therefore the facilities inside the guest room is not meeting my expectation compare with other Double Tree hotels in other country. 1) The electric plug/suis is loosen and seems like will damage at any time. 2) The housekeeping did not clear the trash in the dusbin every day. 3) The basin in pantry is blocked. 4) The housekeeping did not replenish the shampoo / shower cap during our check in. I will still continue to book Double Tree Hotel in other places, however, i will re-consider to come back Banthai Resort on my next visit to Phuket.",
            "We had a very nice vacation in DoubleTree by Hilton. The service was excellent and all the staff are very nice working as a team! We especially like the Duty Manager, Brianne and Front Office Manager, Sunisa for all of their help and for always having a smile and being so kind. We will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and family. Only one suggestion will be for the washrooms, please have the hoses available as this is a very important part for our culture. We will be back!",
            "Ive reached day 7 of what will be a 14 day stay at the DoubleTree, coming as a part of the Phuket sandbox reopening. Located just across the street from Patong beach, I couldnt be happier with my choice to stay at the DoubleTree. As a Marriott Bonvoy Titanium member I had originally booked a Marriott brand hotel, but due to some communication snafus with them, at the last minute I contacted the DoubleTree about changing to their hotel. Thanks to Nitins responsiveness on WhatsApp, within 30 minutes I had booked the hotel, received the required documents, uploaded everything to the Thai COE website, was approved and flying to Phuket 48 hours later. The DoubleTree has gone out of their way to successfully deal with frequently changing Phuket sandbox rules. They organized my taxi pickup at the airport, the required Covid tests, the daily scanning of a QR code on guests phones - and did it all with a smile. They have done a great job of moving from a hotel with just a handful of pre sandbox guests, to one in which occupancy is rapidly increasing each day. Except for a brief stop at the desk each day for a required temperature scan, this feels just like a normal Phuket holiday. Ive enjoyed the morning breakfasts, dinners at The Port restaurant, and drinks on the balcony of my room. My room is on the smaller side, but it is fresh, well furnished and efficiently serviced each day by the housekeeping staff. There has been sufficient free parking, and its within walking distance of several Patong beach restaurants. Thanks DoubleTree, for giving this sandbox tourist a 14 day home away from home."

            "We spent two weeks at this amazing hotel. Situated in lush tropical gardens just 20 minutes from the airport. We stayed in a deluxe room. Our son and family joined us after a couple of days and the mangement thoughtfully placed them in an adjacent room. What makes this hotel special is the staff ethos from the management to the cleaning, waiting staff and gardeners who have created a wonderful environment for this hotel. Another big plus is that all the restaurants serve a la carte menus apart from the breakfast buffet which serves the best buffet ever. The only negative is the price of the wine which is expensive in Thailand 40+ for a bottle of sauvignon blanc for example.",
            "The Renaissance is our Shangri-la, the ambience never fails to entice us to return, as we have done for the past 5 years. The warmth of the welcome back from everyone is emotional. We always ate in the hotel restaurants where praise and thanks need to be relayed to every staff member for the delicious food and exceptional service. The girls in Doppio need credit for their outstanding work ethic which was always carried out with a huge smile. All ran smoothly in the food and beverage department due to the discreet professionalism examplified by Aod with Kate, Kun Pu, R and Moht plus many other members of staff; too many to name were super efficient around the pool area. We experienced lots of fun and laughter instigated by the staff. Another plus for Renaissance. One thing that unsettled us, which is newly introduced is the music by the pool. We use to enjoy relaxing,reading and dozing by the pool but the volume of the disco music made it necessary for us to move far away from the loud boom boom boom of the amplifiers. This is something any possible future guests need to take into consideration. Also at times there were large childrens inflatables in the large pool, with children jumping in and out making it difficult to have a decent swim the length of the pool. There is a separate childrens pool and I think this problem needs addressing. We had to move rooms due to being woken up at 04.30 by cockerels adjacent to the hotel. The front desk staff are so efficient and nothing is too much trouble. They give you the time for any request. A special thanks to Kun HaLL for the help she has given us. Brad GM and Christopher, the executive chef, showed their presence throughout the hotel, spending time to converse with the guests. This we loved to see and experience. The Renaissance is renowned for the breakfast where the choice is unbelievable and all staff super super efficient. Thank you Christopher, executive chef, and your team for your expertise throughout the hotel eateries. Our room was cleaned daily with fresh linen and a lovely surprise of sculptured towels or flowers. Another example of how the staff just go that bit further to make your stay special and one to remember. The Renaissances reputation with predominantly good reviews is only warranted due to every single member of staff. So it is with sincere appreciation and thanks to our Rfamily that we wish them good health and happiness in 2020. We hope that life treats us well and we meet up again. Best wishes Linda and David.

            "Wow, wow, wow. We just left the Renaissance Phuket after a 6 day stay and it was an incredible experience and was beyond our expectations. The folks who work here are the most considerate, welcoming and kind people youll ever meet - from the moment you pull up to the hotel to when they bid you farewell. We stayed in a pool villa and it was stunning. The villa has everything youll need - stocked with coffee and tea and mini bar, your own private infinity pool and chaise loungers, filtered bottled water and Thai villa design that is so cozy and charming. We ate most of our meals at the resort including one night at the hotels Thai restaurant. The food and service is impeccable. The daily breakfast with endless options of traditional American and Thai options is truly an incredible experience. Fresh fruits and juices to omelette station and new daily options even the picky eaters will find something here to satisfy your pallet. The main pool is near the ocean so you easily have both options. The chairs are comfortable and youre served chilled water and cold towels throughout the day. There were several families with small kids at the main pool. (Theres a separate kids pool however kids can use the main pool). We didnt mind the kids but if youre looking for a no kids resort this may not be the place for you. Its a family friendly resort. This hotel is a gem and we couldnt have been happier and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a romantic or family fun getaway. Thank you resistance Phuket. We had the most amazing stay. We will visit again soon!",
            "This is the first time to stay in this hotel. The bed is comfortable with enough space in the room with privacy even the first room type of the hotel. The hotel sent the email to reconfirm any special request before we arrived and this makes this hotel different than other five stars hotels. Especially the service from the staffs in the hotel. FO team explained the details of the hotel and promotion very clear and suggest the best way to use it. After that, we were chilling by the pool and Khun Moht () took care for the towels and drinks without asking for it. After we sat at Sandbox. I myself ordered a drink which isn't in the menu and Khun Moht didn't refuse but say yes to serve watermelon juices and they can do even better by the second drink to make the smoothy for me. At the restaurant Takieng for our dinner, Khun Arm who took care of our table suggest the menu with the details of the dishes and recommended other details of the hotel and Phuket for us. Moreover, Khun Arm provided this same treat to other tables as well which show the good standard of the service. Breakfast is great. Also Thanks the hotel for my wonderful birthday trip. I recommend some of my friends to stay in Renaissance Phuket. The service is very fantastic from every department and a very natural way of them to serve the guests in the hotel. I can say that the hotel is very lucky to have all these staffs. Wish Phuket and the hospitality industry back to be the same soon.",
            "We stayed for five nights over Christmas. If you are looking to stay somewhere away from the mass tourist crowds then this resort is ideal. We felt so relaxed and well catered for. The villas are wonderful. So spacious, private and indulgent. The resort staff are very friendly and attentive, especially around the pool. The resort food can seem expensive, depending on your exchange rate but there is an alternative next less expensive restaurant door on the beach and more restaurants at Turtle Village. The breakfast buffet has a huge selection of food and is worth trying. Overall a highly recommended experience.",
            "This wasnt our original choice but due to a mess up by booking .com ended up coming at their recommendation and have to say absolutely delighted! Everything is ace! Breakfast buffet is simply the best I have ever seen and Ive stayed in some mega places. Room is fab, immaculately clean. We arrived early and the room we could use until ours was ready was perfect. The only downer is the pool area, its too small for the number of guests. If your not with children theres no where to go to escape them. By the third day of our stay the water wasnt very tempting with its colour shall We say. The beach is fab, goes on for days. The staff are just so friendly and accommodating. In particular Kate and Pu in the pool bar are wonderful. Genuinely they want you to have a great time. At breakfast head chef Chris also had a wander round chatting to guests which was a lovely touch. Theres a constant delivery of Iced water and loads of beds and towels. Highly highly recommend.",
            "I went to stay for 1 night with my friend. Finally, I stay here. I have read and seen many reviews including photo by bloggers were very beautiful hotel where many spot for taking photo. Thats why I choose this hotel to stay. The hotel is quite near the airport. Approximately 15 mins to the hotel. In Maikao area there are many hotels closed to the beach and competitive price. At that time this hotel is quite cheap and also used the Travel Together program and also my friend staff rate to discount in hotel program. Therefore, I could say WOW! with this hotel. We got a superior room (1st category room) to stay. The room, balcony and bathroom quite large. The bed so comfortable. But I was wondering that why the hotel doesnt have bidet? I have also comment and staff have explained me that they will be having soon. Next time I think they already have it! In the evening, you may have to beware of theres insects flying into the room. Staff were very very very nice and friendly with us so much. As I comment about the bidet to staff, suddenly I think Front office manager explained to me why they still havent have it. Not only staff at the front but also staff at bar was very friendly and informative with us. Spa is ok but not too good. This place is one of many bloggers took photo. Breakfast also was nice and variety kind of food. Unfortunately, I stayed here only 1 night. I think next time if I have a plan to Phuket again. I definitely consider this hotel to stay.",
            "We still have a couple of days before we have to leave, but I am laying on a sunbed under a beautiful palm tree which keeps you in a perfect shade, while gazing at the idilic, virgin, miles long Mai Khao beach and the endless sea, perfect for swimming, (at least this time of year). It is not my first time visiting Phuket, it definitely won't be my last. I first came to Renaissance some years back, shortly after it opened, I was impressed then, and I am even more impressed now, (after visiting other Phuket resorts), it still looks brand new, they have even made some upgrades. It is beautifully built, in earth-like color tones and wood, almost completely buried in greenery, impeccably kept, and very well managed. I am a picky client and can be a difficult quest at times, but I cannot fault them for anything. The food is amazing, the breakfast setting is perfect, on the lagoon deck, and it has options both for me, given that I prefer a more European breakfast, and for my wife who is simply in love with Thai food. Same goes for dinner, where the chef always carefully prepares my non-spicy food and my wife's impossible spicy courses, every night. The staff is maybe one of the hotel's greatest asset, apart from the hotel's perfect setting on Mai Khao's stunning sunset beach. . Everyone greets you with a warm smile and they go above and beyond to make your stay perfect. Kate is practically everywhere, day in and day out, talking to every single guest, listening to everyone and helping both the guests and the staff. And she manages to do this with such grace and elegance, that you almost feel bad asking her for anything else. We would especially like to thank the food and beverage manager, Mr. Robin Bernhard, who has turned my wife's birthday into a dusk til dawn celebration, in a very tasteful, discreet and 5* worthy manner, ending with a forever to be remembered dinner on the beach at dawn, with candles, lights, table for two and a separate sitting area to enjoy drinks and dessert, perfectly and attentively served. The rooms are large, (we have a garden view kingsize one, with a lovely balcony), very private and with lots of coconut trees in front of it. The room is kept spotless by the cleaning staff, bedding and towels changed daily, water provided in the rooms and on the grounds. We are more of a beach&sea people, but have used the swimming pool a couple of times and it is a real treat, including the jacuzzi. We are planning on returning very soon at Renaissance, thank you for everything, would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for tasteful luxury, and a quiet and serene stay.",
            "We recently booked a week stay at this hotel because our friends were staying there and had been several times previously. They had a fantastic promotion where you booked a room and received food and beverage vouchers each day. We as a family of 5 had a extremely relaxing and enjoyable stay. Kids club was a hit; it was a little small but perfectly suitable for our young kids. The Dino park had a great slide and lovely kids pool. The head chef was engaging and hospitable and the food was healthy and always delivered within a good time (this is important with kids). The staff were accommodating and friendly and the sandbox was a lovely spot to enjoy our dinner and watch the sunset. Khun R in particular was extremely efficient and helpful and went over and above to look after us. Can highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a 5 star hotel in Phuket - location by the airport was great - we only left the hotel to go to turtle village!",
            "This hotel is excellent, very green with a lot of trees and animals (birds, lizards mostly) hanging around. Breakfast is very varied and overall tasty. There are 3 restaurants in the hotel, all offering different vibes and types of food, i would recommend trying them all, they are very good. The awesome mai khao beach is 5 mins away by foot, its my favorite beach in Phuket, with clear waters, almost no-one and a nice grainy sand. The rooms are well designed and furnished, with comfortable beds, excellent shower system and effective and not too loud A/C. Finally, last but not least, the staff is extremely polite, nice and helpful. I warmly recommend this hotel. I have been there twice already."

            "We stayed in the Pool Villa within Anantara Mai Khao's Phuket villas for our honeymoon and we absolutely loved our stay and would really loved to stay longer. The service was really great from the time we arrived. Ivy helped us check in smoothly and gave us a great tour of the resort and the amenities. She even arranged cycles for us to easily access areas of the resort. Thank you Ivy . The breakfast had a great variety and we really enjoyed it and managed to sight the in house monitor lizards. The villa we stayed in was great and comfortable, it had all the facilities we would have generally expected and is top notch, we loved the pool in the villa, it was clean and beautiful. The bed was really comfortable as well. The hotel had easy access to the beach and we enjoyed it. Overall we had no issues with the service, the staff were really friendly and it was an amazing and memorable stay. Thank you team Anantara for making our stay pleasant and memorable. It was truly an unforgettable experience",
            "Phuket was the last leg of our three-week trip to Thailand in December 2019. At the Anantara Mai Khao Phuket Villas Resort we had booked a Lagoon Pool Villa, like all villas of the resort situated in a very well maintained, spacious park. The villa is huge, very tastefully decorated, with a large bathroom, very efficient air conditioning, private pool and additional shower on the terrace. However, our villa was not soundproof, loud neighbours were very annoying. The villas are each a little elevated, with at least four steps between the surrounding park and the pool level and another from the pool level into the villa. Also the large resort pool is only accessible over several steps (positive: First Aid at the pool, pool guards always present), and the reception and the restaurants are not at ground level as well. There are no ramps. All in all, the resort is therefore not barrier-free. The restaurant La Sala offers an extensive breakfast buffet (also Indian, Russian, Arabic, an indication for targeted customers) and in the evenings either la carte or theme dinners (Thai, Indian). The service provided by the always good-humoured Morn and her team (Bee, Fon, Num, Nui, Gheong and Sai) cannot be surpassed. Those who like Thai food should not miss the very instructive and delicious Thai Cooking Class at La Sala. The number of participants is limited to 6 guests (we were only two), so that they are really involved in the preparation of the different dishes and are not only allowed to look over the chef's shoulder. What we prepared afterwards was our lunch, and it tasted excellent. By the way, wine lovers should be prepared all over Thailand for prices for imported wines that are too high for our standards. We were told that the import duties for foreign wines are 250 percent. If you add in the profit margin, you quickly reach over 200 Euros for a bottle of wine. But Thai food is more suited to local beer than wine anyway.",
            "We arrived at the Anantara after a long trip and was greeted by smiling faces and a beautiful Villa set in wonderful tropical surroundings. The very large and beautifully appointed Villa was our base for the fortnight. The maids with their smiling faces set the scene for our very hard day, eating breakfast, walking the beach and swimming in ones own pool or the large hotel pool. Our own Guest Relations lady, Malee, was magnificent through out our stay, on hand at all times to organise our day, even when not on site, 'What's App' was on hand!! The breakfasts were a dream, set around the Lagoon with everything one may want, local fruits, hot and cold and if not on display Richy or Fon were on hand to sort. What wonderful staff, trained to perfection and always smiling and there to help. The H&B Manager, Fausto ensured that ones' delights were always catered for, in his great Italian manner and flamboyant shirts. The pool area, looking out to sea was beautiful and the staff ensured that cold water was a plenty and the umbrellas were set for the sun or the shade. It was also a wonderful place to watch the evening sunset with a cocktail! The gardens are beautiful with an abundance of fabulous tropical plants that are meticulously cared for. Whilst we were there the sea was plagued by some jelly fish and sea lice, which gave a nasty sting. That meant swimming in the beautiful, warm sea had to be reserved for the next time. Thanks to all the team for making our stay so memorable.",
            "Just returned from a two week stay at Mai Khao Villas. My partner and I needed a holiday to recharge and reset. We got that in bundles at this beautiful location. From the moment we arrived to the moment we departed, we were made to feel very special by all the staff. The accomodation was absolutely stunning. We had chosen a villa with a 'sala' over the lagoon. The additional cost of this was totally worth it as it became our tranquil haven each afternoon, as we relaxed and listened to the birds overhead. We also had a special dinner on the sala for our anniversary, with our own private chef (Sunni) who cooked an amazing selection of food for us. The villa was extremely spacious, with it's own terrace and small pool to cool off in. We spent more time here than at the larger swimming pool only because it was such a shame not to. Anantara certainly look after their guests. I'd never stayed at a location where everytjing from sun cream, after sun, hats, flip flops and even a beach bag were provided in the villa. We also had complimentary bicycles, which were great for seeing the local area as well as getting around the resort. There are plenty of dining options too, with both buffet and a la carte options available at La Sala, Sea Fire Salt and The Tree House. My partner and I are both vegans and we had no problem discussing our dietry requirements with the staff and being served what we wanted. Special mention must be made to Saifon and Sep who looked after us during our stay, attending to our every need. In the restaurants, Chef Sunni created delicious vegan food for us on more that one occasion, not least of all the 'Dining by Design' dinner at our villa. At La Sala, we loved our daily interactions with Morn and Fon, both delightful ladies. The resort is on a most gorgeous beach but it's difficult to tear yourdelf away from the luxury of the resort to enjoy it. The area around the resort is fairly quiet with just a few shops,supermarkets and restaurants but that didn't bother us as we wanted to enjoy the resort as much as possible. I would definetely recommend this resort to anybody who doesn't want the hustle and bustle of other resorts on Phuket.",
            "We came here as a birthday present for my husband and I, as soon as we arrived we got a fantastic service with a smile. All staff have been incredibly friendly and polite. Especially as vegetarians on half board, Sunny and Atul were able to make special meals for us even on buffet nights. All staff went out of their way to accommodate us and make us feel more than welcome. Sao fook golf was amazing at breakfast, always made sure we had what we needed. All staff on the resort were great! Had 5 fantastic treatments at the spa, which were abit pricey however we received vouchers for spa treatment upon arrival which allowed us more luxuries. We stayed in a villa, which the phone villa pictures speak for themselves. Location is abit isolate, but a taxi person for a day wont cost you more than 80.0 for a day and wait for you will your tour to take you back. Highly recommend.",
            "The area is pretty, highly recommend to choose Lagoon Pool Villa. Villas are clean, breakfast is awesome. Location is a bit far but it's a really good choice for families! Especially if you've visited in Phuket before and try to avoid noisy areas and nightlife. Nice gym with good air-condition. Spa is great as well, good variety of treatments. Beach restaurant (Sea, Fire, Salt) was a bit expensive but La Sala highly recommended. Indian, arabic and thai food - excellent choice and good service. Special thanks to Pook for excellent service!! <3 Me and my son appreciated your hospitality so much! I will come back, atmosphere (sound of birds in the mornings<3) is stunning. Relaxing oasis in northern part of Phuket.",
            "I have been to Treehouse Bar at Anantara Maikao Villa often. The stairs up to Treehouse Bar there is a big tree, its very beautiful and I feel like Im in the forest Good location with nature.The Bar has only lady staff that they are very friendly and have excellent service, I can remember their name Ann, Aun, Noey especiallyPang She has a very beautiful smile and good service mind. The Drinks are wonderful with Signature Cocktails, Whisky, Wine and Beer, very important the price is reasonable. They also serve complimentary delicious popcorn and peanut together with my drink and I really like it, but if you want to have dinner they also have the food service. Overall is Perfect!!! with Location, Food, Drink and Excellent Service. And Sorry!!! I didnt have much photo for review.",
            "I am not sure where to start really with our review in regards of this stunning property and its amazing staff. So will start with a Huge THANK YOU to all the great Team members from reception, house keeping, garden, restaurants , bar all we have met whom looked so well after us during our stay! From the moment reservation was made to the moment we arrived in this little paradise we knew this was the place for us! As for the reasons of this very special stay why we chose Anantara Maikhao. Wonderful gardens so well-manicured, beautiful pool villa with great privacy, superb amenities ample space, yes surely you expect this from a 5 star property though this is so much more. A fantastic pool with great views to the sea and open horizon. Excellent bar called Infinity which I will write a separate review as this is a unique place to hang out and shoot the breeze due to the great Team running it, making it very special. Great restaurants La Sala, Tree House, Sea, Salt & Fire which I will write also separate praising reviews for each due to the exceptional service and food we experienced at all meals periods. A truly beautiful property which we really enjoyed roaming around either by walk or bicycles appreciating the attention to details and the efforts to keep it so well maintained. We would like to thanks James (GM) for his great hospitality and for driving such an amazing team creating memorable experiences. Last but not least Heart full very Special Thanks to Pavi and Eve both are true gems they know very well why!!! We will be back! C&A",
            "This place is heaven-on earth like. Nothing is too much for the staff, every single one of them will go out of their way to ensure you have a fabulous stay. Every staff that we encountered were extremely friendly around the whole property. The rooms are very big and the private pool is a real unique touch, our children could stay in there for ever. We dined in every outlet whilst we stayed over the weekend and everything was perfect. The quality of the seafood at sea fire and salt was great as well as the Thai food offerings at la sala. What really stood out of this hotel, is the service and the friendliness of the staff. They make you feel at home and nothing is never too much for them. A big thanks to Fausto, Kae & toy from the breakfast restaurant, the lovely ladies from the kids club and especially Khun Yah for making our stay a beautiful family memory. The service really stood out and we are planning another hotel later this year already.",
            "Villas are really incredible, they are so comfortable, spatious, and private. The pool is big, and you have everything you possibly need inside the villa. There are plenty of details very well thought. We were staying in a Sala Villa, and I must admit that we did not use the Sala, the chill-out space next to the pool was comfortable enough. Service in the hotel is exceptional, all of our requests were answered in a very efficient manner. Staff is very welcoming and always ready to help, even anticipating our needs. However, you should know that the hotel is very up north, and far from everything. Perfect if you want to relax and be far from the crowd (although with Covid situation, all of the turistic places were empty) Restaurants inside the hotel are good, but very expensive (similar or even more expensive than a good restaurant in Europe), and prices are not even including 17% of service charge and goverment taxes, which is very annoying. Typically a glass of wine will cost you 10 Euros (not including taxes). The turtle village next to the hotel has some restaurants options (less expensive than the hotel, but still expensive for Thailand), although most of them were closed due to the current situation. Also there is a 7 Eleven opened. SPA is also very expensive, but the quality of the massages and service, it was just perfect. We really enjoyed it. Swimming pool area was very nice, comfortable and perfect to relax as well. The beach is very beautiful, big and wild, with no one to be seen (note that it's not the typical lagoon beach, waves are big which makes it even difficult for swimming, that said it was the most beautiful beach in Phuket for me). However, something that was very heart-braking is the amount of plastics and garbage in the sand and sea. Very disappointing that no one seems to be taking actions. Regarding Sandbox program, the arrival process at the airport was smooth and well organized. A big thank you to all the staff for making this stay really incredible."

            "It took me a few months to write this review and finally i did it. I was visiting Amari Phuket for the second time because had only best memories after my first visit. I wanted to repeat the experience. I booked a room in advance and specified that I'd like to stay in the same room as on my previous visit but something went wrong. I changed rooms for 3 !!! times. I came on vacation not for moving from one room to another. I was very frustrated and upset. Especially after 3 years of lockdown and my first vacation. I should also admit that cleaning room service became worse in comparison to my first visit. I wrote an email to Manager of the hotel. And this is what i want to make the most precious! People is the real gem of this place!!!. Personnel and the attitude is the reason why i will be returning to this place again and again (and breakfasts). Alexandre was very professional, client-oriented and polite. He made the rest of my vacation fantastic. And I want to say special thanks to him. If you are not happy with something at Amari, just talk to staff. Give them a chance to make it better! I also want to say that breakfast is totally fantastic in this place. Such a wide range of food and drinks. Coconut water and freshly squeezed juices were my favourites& And smoked tune. I definitely plan to bring my elder parents to this place to enjoy the beauty and the atmosphere of this place.",
            "Amari Phuket. Where do I even start? Right from the beginning, this amazing resort felt like home. Upon checking in at the resort, we were informed by the receptionist, who was attending to us, that our room was upgraded from a superior double room to a one bedroom suite. The room had a spacious living and dining area, joined to a well equipped kitchen. The ensuite bedroom included a huge bed and a modern bathroom with a big shower. One of the days during our stay, we returned to our room after a long day of sightseeing and, to our absolute delight, we were given a complimentary fruit bowl and other delicious snacks. We absolutely loved the fruit and snacks, but the fact that these were given by the resort with compliments came as no surprise to us. The entire place is filled with positive energy! Each and every person working at the resort is unbelievably friendly and willing to help. The staff made our stay an absolute breeze. There are also shuttles three times a day to Patong Beach, which is only a 10 minute walk away in any case, with Bangla Road just a little bit further. The resort is absolutely beautiful. It has a private beach and two stunning pools. It is also home to 3 restaurants which all boast a stunning sea view and which all cater some extremely tasty food and drinks. The resort is perfect if you want to enjoy some peace and quiet, but is also a walking distance from the busy market and night life scene, making it ideally located. I haven't stayed at other resorts in Phuket but I've stayed in many resorts around the world and I have to say that the Amari Phuket is hands down the best one I've stayed at thus far. Highly recommend.",
            "Amari Phuket is a wonderful luxurious resort which is very close to the world famous Patong Beach in Phuket. We stayed there for a couple of nights in the ocean wing suite. Great part is that it has got its own private beach too which provides you privacy to enjoy with family. Our ocean wing suite room had a living room with a small dining table and a balcony which opens up out to spectacular views of the ocean. There was also a small kitchen with all cutlery in case you want to cook up something on your own. The bedroom was spacious and was very well done up in yellow pastels color with a big glass mirror which made the room seem even more bigger and also provided quick way to get ready without going inside the washroom and use the mirror there. The bed was very comfortable and provided great sleep after our journey. The washroom had wonderful facilities like rain shower, hair-dryer, shaving point, complimentary toiletries and of course bathrobe with slippers. Amari Phuket also provided regular free shuttle services from the hotel to Patong beach which is around 5-10 mins drive in their branded tuk-tuk. Of course you can get regular taxis or Grab taxi very easily too from Amari Phuket. If you are looking for an amazing stay for the family at Phuket in Thailand without being too far away from the tourist attractions, you should definitely consider Amari Phuket which is one of the best hotels in Thailand!",
            "I can honestly say weve had an incredible time here. Weve been truly spoilt by the staff. I completed a survey which the hotel sent to me during our stay and I highlighted a small issue. The following morning Kate one of the managers found us at breakfast and was so apologetic. We were upgraded and the regional manager Pierre-Andre Pelletier sent us food gifts to our room. He also visited us whilst at dinner to ensure everything was up to standard. We were not expecting this, we just wanted to make the hotel aware of the issue. The service is fabulous and the staff cannot do enough for you. The food at la gritta (Italian) is amazing and has sea views which is really pretty at night. Rim Talay is the buffet style restaurant where we had breakfast each morning. The restaurant is beach side, was so lovely to wake up each morning and have breakfast over looking the sea. The hotel is just the right distance away from the nightlife. There are plenty of bars and restaurants nearby within walking distance or a tuk tuk will cost around 200thb which are outside the hotel. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle service 3 times a day to the centre. The rooms are beautiful and over look the sea. Very clean and modern. The staff work extremely hard to keep these high standards. Thank you so much to Kate, gypsy and Pierre for an amazing stay. We will most definitely be returning in the near future. Maria & Matt",
            "I cannot in a short review praise this hotel and its staff highly enough. Everyone from arrival to departure made us feel extra special and we enjoyed each of our 11 nights. It is an oasis of peaceful bliss with beautiful views and pool days, boat trips, free lifts to shopping or Karin beach we looked forward to each day with great breakfast in open air locations with panoramic views across the inlet / bay of Patong. We arrived here after trips to Bangkok and Chiang Mai where we did a lot of sightseeing. Here was more relaxing arriving on our anniversary to a lovely heart shaped cake in our upgraded room with a balcony right above the beach with wonderful views. We paid 200 baht on our first night to take us down to Patong but walked there and back every day afterwards. The hill coming back is a bit steep but a rest to take in the views was a pleasure. We paid 2500 baht for a boat trip for a couple of hours round the coast and back and enjoyed Fantasy beach so much we went back there to snorkel the following day. Not far from Amari along the coast we could see elephants in the water at a sanctuary further away but didnt actually go there. The people working in the hotel are all fantastic from the gardeners and maintenance to cleaners reception and managers. We met Pierre Andre Pelletier who was charming and though Vice President of the hotel chain through the Maldives served me coffee on my first morning and arranged for champagne and treats as a surprise in our room one day. All waiters at breakfast work hard and each with a professionalism when some more unsavoury guests spoke to the harshly without cause. Young Monton was a perfect example and looked after us well. Our cleaner Justins looked after our every request and free bottles of water in our room with smiles every day. At reception young Kate a trainee must be destined for great things in hotel hospitality as she made every conversation into a quest to see to our every need with smiles and sincerest of courtesies. We are back home now and just looking back at our wonderful time there is easy but cannot capture just how good it was in this Amari Phuket our favourite hotel in all our travels so far.",
            "My wife and I stayed at The Amari Beach Hotel for a second time lat week and we must say that this hotel is possibly the best beach location hotel we have ever stayed in! From the moment you arrive and are welcomed from any of the reception staff to Pierre the Vice President of the hotel group, you experience service that is second to none. We stayed in a De luxe Ocean View room that was 30 feet from the sea and beach, with a glass fronted balcony overlooking the bay with palm trees giving you that all important bit of shade. To save you walking anywhere, they provide a courtesy service using electirc golf buggies! We experienced all of the restaurants on site and the food and drink was delicious,served by polite and informative staff. We also made use of their free shuttle bus into Patong shopping centre which is only a short walk away but is very useful when carrying bags of shopping!!! The highlight for us though was the amazing experience you get from accessing the Club Lounge and Pool at the top of the hotel complex. The views across the bay from the infinity pool are amazing and together with iced cold water and cold towels provided by the Club staff you feel really pampered! We had breakfast there and together with their Happy Hour we enjoyed every minute of it. Of course none of this would be the same if it was not for the staff. Obviously highly trained they have the philosophy of making you feel welcome. In the Club Lounge special mention must go to Meme, Miki, Ying , Monica and the others whose names I forget, whose service was exceptional. Were we sad to leave this place, of course we were, and we now judge every hotel by the standard that the Vice President (Pierre)and his Manager (Richard)have set. Thank you all, for an incredible stay at your resort. Cannot wait to come back!",
            "The room we had was in the main part of the hotel and we felt this was a better location than needing a golf buggy for the club access upgrade. Ate at both restaurants and the food and beach location were stunning, although slightly expensive. Two great pools with great views. Watched the sunset on the private pier. The lobby bar is also very good. Breakfast choice is vast and the location amazing. All staff could not do enough for you but a special mention for natthaphon during the happy hour specials. Always smiling",
            "We stayed with friends for three weeks in February and I must say we were impressed from the start. We arrived at around 9.30 in the morning and to find our rooms were ready for us straight away, we were greeted by Pierre-Andre who informed us that the rooms were ready as they knew what time we were expected, which we found both thoughtful and impressive. We stayed in one bedroon suites with balconies and club access which were spacious with wonderful views from the balcony and had the most comfortable bed and pillows that we have ever experienced in our many years of travel. All the clubhouse staff were exceptional and the service and attention were second to none, I am coeliac and all the staff went out of their way to accommodate my need for gluten free food from gluten free bread and choices at breakfast, gluten free cookies with coffee during the day and during the cocktail hour there was always a seperate collection of gluten free canaps for me to enjoy all of which were very much appreciated. The service and attention from the management, the buggy drivers, and all the other staff was again exceptional and we would like to thank the entire team for a wonderful relaxing stay.",
            "What a trip to remember. It was a ladies weekend and we last minute decided to find a place for Saturday night fun. We were able to get a hold of Amari as they had 2 bedroom suites. We were 5 adults and they were easily able to accommodate us. The view was unbelievable and the suite really felt like home. What made a big impression was the staff.. Like Kate and pretty much everyone in the Clubhouse. They truly give attention to details and they were really sincere in accommodating all of our needs. We all know its tough times atm and we are so happy to support this hotel because they truly take good care of their employees. It shows in their work ethic ..Will definitely come back to this place.. Paradise!",
            "We booked a trip here in August 2019, with a deluxe ocean view room. The beach was right outside our patio on the second floor. Yes, the beach is all rocks at very low tide, but the tide changes constantly throughout the day. The jetty is a wonderful place to snorkel but unfortunately, we did not have time to do that. The hotel provides complimentary water on a daily basis, and we used this to brush our teeth as well, since we did not want to risk any stomach issues from ingesting water from the faucet. The view from the hotel are beautiful."

            "We stayed in the Katahani Beach Resort, Phuket for 10 nights in Mid July after visiting Chiang Mai. This is the rainy season so we expected to get wet and knew we'd have cloudy days as well as sun, which we did. Temperatures were good though and quite muggy on some days. We had booked a Junior Suite room that looked over the pools and sea views. Fantastic room, very big, very clean and was 9 out of 10. Aircon was a bit noisy and you had to keep this on at all times and do not open the balcony doors, otherwise your room becomes very damp. Never enough clothes hangers either lol The hotel itself is set over quite a large site and is extremely clean, with great attention to detail in keeping it perfect. The hotel staff are probably some of the best we've met and are very attentive and go above and beyond to give you what you need. Check in and check out was easy and the food and drink in the different restaurants was excellent, but pricey (see below) We had booked \"Bed & Breakfast\" as that was the only alternative offered. This gave us the option to choose from the various restaurants that the hotel had to offer, or go out to eat at the local bars and restaurants. The loungers by the pools are excellent, never too busy and the pool areas are cleaned every morning. The pool temperatures were great and we loved swimming in them. The beach was cleaned every morning as a lot of debris was washed up from other areas due to the strong tide and winds. The sea for us was very disappointing and rather dangerous. Red Flags every day, with the exception of a couple of days, where red/yellow flags were put into certain areas that the lifeguards deemed safer. Considering how strong the sea is, I was shocked to see that there are no \"lifebuoy Rings\" along the beach. (4 or 5 rings around each pool), but none along the beach. I also feel as though the lifeguards could have more safety equipment/boat. To me, the safety along the beach needs looking at and was very disappointing. A few other points that let us down a bit on this holiday was the prices for food and drink at the Hotel itself and surrounding restaurants. To give you an idea: We ate in the Italian restaurant on site. I had a 330ml bottle of Singh beer with dinner. This was 165thb per bottle, which when converted at the exchange of 40thb per pound, equated to 4.12 per bottle. It's 99p in Tesco. This made me start looking at everything we bought and I found again that a 200gm piece of salmon in the Fishermans Wharf restaurant cost us 460thb.. Again, this worked out at 11.50 for a 200gm piece of salmon. A bottle of Chiang or Singh beer by the pool is 105thb = 2.63. The cocktails were great and i especially loved the Banana Collada. These weren't too bad on price being 250thb... 6.25, but still more than I was hoping for. Happy hour in the cocktail opposite is 99thb.. that's more like it. These are a couple of examples of the prices you'll be paying. It's not cheap and I felt very captive. There are literally only a handful of restaurants and bars outside which are a little cheaper, but not much. Go in to Phuket Town you could say... We did and it was 45 minutes by taxi and cost 30 return. When we stayed in Chiang Mai the week before, the prices were so much cheaper and more what I expected. I certainly didn't believe that I'd be paying more to eat and drink in Thailand than I do in England. We've travelled quite a bit and if I'm honest, we wouldn't return to Thailand. It didn't meet the quality of other far away destinations that we've been to. We've got great memories of the experiences we had in Thailand like The James Bond Island, Night Markets, Elephant sanctuary in the jungle (Chiang Mai), canoeing in under water caves etc... Memories that I'll have forever, so for that reason, thank you Thailand. You'll make your own minds up on reviews and holidays and as I stated, the Hotel and staff tick lots of boxes, but in my opinion, let itself down by the expensive prices that it charges because you are a captive audience there. If I'd have known of its prices when I was reading reviews, I wouldn't have gone.",
            "We spent 4 nights in the hotel with my husband and with my 8 years old daugter. We didnt liked Phuket before but this hotel on that magnificient beach changed our opinion. The hotel is really huge and it occupeies the whole Kata Noi beach. We booked a junior suite. Upon arrival the sofa bed was already transformed to accomodate our child. We really loved the big room, the big bathroom and the seaview balcony. We missed the hangers in the bathroom, there is only one hanger where you can put your towel. The garden is full of amazing coconut palms and is well maintained. There are 6 pools - if Im right -, plenty of sunbeds enough for everybody. The brekfast restaurant was close to tour room. The breakfast was good but the best was on our last day when we arrived at 7 AM because our early flight. We found so much more things, like the yogurts in small glasses with fruit on top and tiny fruit plates with a selection of fruits. I had every morning omelette and I like the to eat it with tomatoes. I found tomatoes only on one morning, which was strange, this is a basic vegetable! I wrote my opinion on the questionnaire found there but Ive seen it on the last day as well, I hope that somebody will read it once... The selection of cereals was good, better than at Conrad Hotel in Bangkok! The fruit juices were incredibly sweet and artificially, we didnt liked them. The guys at the Andaman pool were very kind and welcoming as well as the guards at the beach exit. Each guest finds in the room a beach bag and a beach towel per person. The towels are changed in the rooms around 6 PM. The drinks and the food at the pool bars and in the restaurants is ridiculously pricy! It is not allowed to bring food and drinks from outside in the hotel but everybody makes it, avoiding selling their kidney... The sea was pretty wavy which was a surprise for us and we had fun! For those who are not good swimmers could be very dangerous. There are a few shops, massage shops and restaurants on the street behind the hotel. The restaurants are very pricy, the massage places were good with well trained staff. It is possible to buy the beach bag, the laundy bag in the Melon shop in the hotels. I looked after the laundry bag at the Melon shop but the shop assistant has no clue what I was talking about. Id like to return to the hotel but my husband doenst likes to return, but I try to change his mind!",
            "We were unsure about staying here as we normally stay at small hotels. We need not have worried as the hotel was excellent. We had a Junior Suite Sea View in the Kata Noi wing and would recommend this room to anyone staying. It was a good size and the view of the pools, the grounds and the sea was incredible. Watching the sunset from our balcony just perfect. The maid service/housekeeping was excellent and our room was spotless every day. The bathroom in the room was very good with a bath (we didn't use this) and a large shower. The shower was powerful and always with warm water. The room was also silent. We never heard our neighbours or any noise from outside of our room. The hotel grounds were swept and manicured early every morning and were just perfect. We preferred to sunbathe on the grass near the sea and the grass was kept in excellent condition. The pools are very good but mostly we swam in the sea. The pool bar waiters are very good and quickly knew when we liked to drink and what we would like. Every afternoon, they made our cocktails exactly as we liked them. There are many restaurants in the hotel and we ate at all of them. All were very good. From the breakfast restaurant (the selection is vast and it was never very busy) to the very high class La Scala, every meal we had was good. Our favourite, if only for the extra ambience, was Fisherman's Wharf. As with all of the restaurants, it's best to reserve a table the day before. We were fortunate enough to attend the Christmas and New Year's Eve gala dinners. Both were the best such events we have ever seen. In the week before each event a huge team of workers transformed the garden into first a Christmas wonderland and then into a mythical forest. After making it so good for Christmas, we thought they would use the same set for New Year, but the same army of workers took it all away and changed it completely. The amount of work and the attention to detail was remarkable. There are only a few hotels that we would visit twice, regardless of how good they are. This is definitely one of them. We like to holiday over Christmas and would certainly consider returning to Phuket and to this hotel. Our massive thanks to all of the staff who made our Christmas and New Year perfect!!",
            "The Katathani is a large resort on kata noi beach spread across both sides of the road. The resort boasts 5 pools, 6 restaurants; tennis courts, 3 beach bars and 2 breakfast areas situated in immaculately maintained grounds which serve Asian, Continental and traditional cooked breakfasts as well as a great pastries section not to mention our personal favourite the pancake making machines. The resort is about 15-20 min walk up many hills to the heart of kata town,however the hotel does offer a shuttle service and there are some shops and some good restaurants outside the hotel. The hotel is a very popular wedding destination however some of these parties can be quite intrusive to the other guests in terms of noise and traffic however the resort is large enough to find a quiet spot away from the noise. The beach bars offer a table service for food and drink though the food menu has limited options the food is great quality and staff are polite and efficient, the restaurant all offer very good quality food with many choice of restaurants from Italian to traditional Thai food, our personal favorite was the Fishermans wharf, however the hotel is now showing its age now and some of the wings are going through renovations which I hope will be carried through to the rest of the hotel. We opted for a grand suite in the Thani wing with a great beach view room, however our room was looking tired and the mini bar was empty you have to call room service and ask for what you need and also had the most complicated light switches system with over 20 different light switches for our suite, we also found the bed to very hard but to the staffs credit they improved the bed by adding several mattress toppers. In conclusion this a large resort more suited to families and wedding parties rather than a couples resort, it is situated on one of the best beaches in Phuket however at times you do feel like you are in a utlins Holiday camp. The staff are very friendly and the food is very good but due to size of the resort you sometimes loose that personal touch and that attention to detail you get from smaller luxury hotels",
            "We stay at the resort for 6 nights and loved it! It was our first trip to Thailand with a 4.5 year old and 6 yr old during peak Xmas period. Was a little worried about Thailand after visiting Hawaii and didnt expect the experience to be as great. The resort is so beautiful we felt very comfortable. The resort is big never felt busy. 5 star and very kid friendly and it had a separate section for singles/couples very well thought out. Kids Club was very safe, clean and secure we are helicopter parents but had no issues leaving them there as they loved the activities and play area. It is a little out from central Phuket which we preferred. The main lobby smelled so nice wish I could bottle the fragrance and take it home. Sanitizing liquid everywhere for you to use and they supplied free water to brush teeth and drink which was awesome. The local streets/locations was enough of the Thai experience for us. Overall a fantastic resort. We stayed at the The Sands Khao Lak by Katathani the next 6 nights - love this chain of resorts.",
            "Really enjoyed our stay here. Fantastic location with lots to do in the resort and facilities to go explore the rest of the island. The resort is absolutely huge with 5 pools, 5 restaurants and a few bars. It is located on Kata Noi beach which is a bit isolated meaning most of the visitors to the beach will be from the resort and so it was comparatively quiet on the beach. The beach itself is public and the hotel's property includes pools right next to the beach so you can plant yourself on a bed next to the pool viewing the beach and take turns stepping out onto the beach/sea and being by/in the pool. The restaurants include a Thai, Italian, Pizza/pasta, seafood, breakfast/lunch all-rounder and a buffet. Breakfast was reasonable but not amazing (particularly as a vegetarian) but the dinners were great (don't eat seafood so can't review that one). The bars and restaurants will cater towards dietary requirements if you ask about making particular items vegetarian for example. The only disappointment was that the buffet restaurant didn't have many vegetarian options but it was the one that had interesting entertainment on most nights. Nice, clean rooms. Plenty of activities and classes (chess, petanque, thai boxing, aqua aerobics). Shuttle service available to Patong and taxis line up outside.",
            "We stayed here for 3 weeks in January 22 and had a very relaxing break. We had a room in Thani Wing which are good sized rooms with a comfortable balcony. The beds are so big that our 3 year old shared our bed rather than turning the sofa into another bed. The staff here were consistantly helpful and friendly which is of course a bit of a trade mark for Thailand generally. Being there for 3 weeks meant many staff got to know us a bit and were always welcoming. There are at least 7 pools so plenty of space to lay out, as well as all the lawned landscaping throughout the resort. The kids pool was very popular with our young daughter and most days had to include a visit to it. There is a kids club beside the childrens pool that is also good for giving toddlers an hour or tow of distraction. The beach is just stunning and becuase of its location it is almost deserted all the time. As the bay is somewhat sheltered the sea is lovely and clear and when the tide is out you can wade out quite a way before it gets deep. Sunsets are amazing and many were spent with a cold beer at the pool bar. The Fishermans restaurant was a popular lunch time haunt for us, we ate in the Italian and Thai restaurants too which were good. The only let down on the food front was the Buffet nights, which apart from New Years Eve which was amazing, was otherwise very average. That said there are endless dining options within a few minutes of the hotel for all budgets. The Boathouse and Mums Kitchen are both excellent choices for a romantic evening and many others close by. The rooms are not to a five star standard in finishing but are equally very comfortable and fine for what is essentially a beach holiday. We have already booked to go back there for Easter this year!.",
            "My wife and I stayed at Katathani Beach Resort on our first trip to Phuket. We could not have picked a better Resort fro where we wanted. We stayed in a grand suite which was a really large space and we requested a beach view which was fantastic. We did not want to tour too much , but rather be able to slow down and relax and not leave the resort on any day if we did nit what to. Katathani is an all encompassing resort with everything you need from with many restaurants, easy access to the beach, multiple pools, spa, gymnasium , convenience store and bars that do amazing cocktails. We cannot speak highly enough about the staff who were all extremely helpful, happy and polite - you could tell they liked where they work. Any request we had was handled with ease and efficiency. While the resort had birth families and couples - this was not a hindrance to us in any way as we love the family environment and there are separate pools for adults and kids. The beach was not crowded and almost exclusive, even though anyone can access it. We ate at the Fishermans wharf twice which was great and also at the Thai restaurant which was just ok ( we went with the waiters suggestions of the signature dishes which were good , but underwhelming. Standard Thai fare , so if you already like Thai food - pick your favourites or give it a miss) We tried a couple of restaurants over the road that are also very good and more moderately priced but the food is still inexpensive by Australian standards. We stayed on the beach side of the resort and discovered there is more of the resort over the road from the beach so make sure you know which location you are booking. We had a very enjoyable and relaxing stay and can highly recommend this resort. We are planning our next trip already and will definitely go back.",
            "After bay-hopping with a week at each of the Amari Patong, Beyond Karon, and Beyond Kata we splashed out for our final 5 days at the Katathani, paying about 50% more than the other hotels. Whilst breakfasts weren't quite as good as the excellent Amari, service levels were very good, and the Katathani was superior in all other respects (room quality, cleanliness, facilities, attractive grounds, pools, sunbeds, etc), and it was worth paying the extra if you can afford it; a nice touch was the masseurs who offer good massages in the shady gardens at very good rates. The complex dominates the pretty 700 metre beachfront of Kata Noi, and our Junior Suite in the Thani wing had great views across one of the many pools to the beach, with nice sunsets from our balcony. Kata Noi has limited shops and restaurants, half of which belong to the Katathani and are relatively expensive as you would expect at a 5-star hotel, but there is a good restaurant Siam Smile immediately outside; about 30 metres from this is a good minimart, and adjacent to that is a little taxi/tour booth K.T.Smile providing an efficient cheap taxi service to the airport (1000 baht) and nearby Kata restaurants (100 baht).",
            "Weve stayed here several times and with good reason. The hotel is situated on the KataNoi beach which is absolutely stunning. Beautiful soft sand that stretches out and is super clean and tidy. Its also not too packed busy either. The hotel pools of which there are many are also right next to the beach in case you dont fancy the sea itself. You can get massages for cheap right by the pool and there are bars available for food and drinks etc. the breakfasts are great with all sorts to choose from whether you like the Thai/Asian style or more western food - its all there. Room service is also very reasonable and tasty. There are also several restaurants at the hotel and I would recommend the fishermans wharf in particular which is right by the beach overlooking the sea view. They can also cater for private dining for special events and weve done that a few times and its fantastic. For those who cant keep still by the pools then there are loads of activities to do. Surfing, tennis, table tennis, two gyms and those with kids would love the special water park pool on site. Theres also a kids club I think. However the number one reason is not the stunning the location, nor the beautiful palm tree dappled gardens or food. Its the staff. They are so friendly and kind and generous with their time. You can tell that they really want you to have a good time and that they also love their jobs there. Weve been 5 times now and as members you get discounts on food and room prices. We always try to stay here a week when we come to Thailand and as you can tell I love it here."

            "Deserving its family friendly reputation, Club Med Phuket provided a perfect location for our multi generational group of 16, celebrating grandpas 70th birthday. The sprawling resort, rather tired and in need of a modern makeover, took a few days to orientate, and advise pre requesting rooms in blocks closest to main area, and on ground floor for easy access, particularly parents with strollers. The Mini Club was fabulous, warm and friendly carers, clean, well thought out and safe facilities, varied and stimulating activities. Buffet meals are excellent, though a week of self-serve was quite enough for us. Regrettably, the alternate adult restaurant offered a very limited menu. Cheers to the friendly and accommodating resort photographer who arrange a family shoot on the beach - precious memories!",
            "This great Club Med Resort is spread along the beach with lots of Shady Gardens and quiet places to sit and relax. I enjoyed the adults only pool and the nearby bar. Rooms were clean and tidy although not huge they had all the facilities that you would want in a resort here's a tip if you have an ocean facing room you may have water views but this is not guaranteed because there is so many beautiful trees in the gardens. Sports facilities with first-rate fantastic squash and basketball and all the family enjoyed the Archery. I highly recommend doing the snorkelling trip which is also included for free it was very well run and I felt comfortable the instructors looked after everyone very well.",
            "This hotel just blew us away and was so much better than we were expecting. In a perfect location and probably 4 nights in a row we went to get massages from a place that was probably a 1-minute walk away, great for accessing markets and other shops. Having the all you can eat buffet, we were never hungry. The buffet made it great especially when you have teenage boys. The local beach was great and we went there every day either for swimming, a walk, the sunset. The bar was incredible and our favourite bartender was ray as he was very nice and made u feel very welcomed, all the drinks were incredible, especially considering you can have the at any time. We were completely blown away by this resort !",
            "This is our second trip to Club Med Phuket. It is a great place to visit with something for everyone. Great flights offered from Perth and we were looked after with the transfers. The resort is about an hour from the airport but we enjoy the trip, looking at all the scenery on the way. We are a large family and my kids were not bored or hungry once. The staff are amazing and go out of their way to make you feel special and if you need anything they do their best to help you. My son loved the teen club experience and made some great friends including the GOs who looked after him. Seeing them around the resort having fun was great. They were always laughing and busy! Unfortunately, this visit there wasnt any younger girls on the days my girls wanted to go to teen club so my younger ones decided not to attend but this didnt stop them from making friends at the pool and having just as much fun as the boys. The food was awesome with variety to suit all needs and wants. Unfortunately the second al a carte restaurant is only open for dinner at the moment. There were good drink options available. The activities were great and it was sometimes hard to choose which ones to do as there were a lot to choose from! The rooms were presented nice and had everything you need but are a little tired. Housekeeping folded an elephant on the bed in each room and my kids loved this. You dont need to take many toiletries as the basics are supplied for you and they smell so nice. I would suggest taking some conditioner if you have long hair as the conditioning shampoo wasnt great for my girls long hair after being in the water every day. The water pressure in our room was average going hot and cold but manageable. We dont spend a lot of time in the room so it isnt an issue. The pool is great and you have the option of an adults only area which is nice and quiet with an infinity pool. The Spa has some good services options but can be a little pricey along with the boutique. Compared with outside the resort. More daily specials would be appreciated, especially for big families wanting to spoil everyone! There was a good variety of tours available but again these were very expensive for large families and we ended up organising our own adventures. You dont actually have to leave the resort but this trip we were desperate to go on an outing to see the elephants! A big thank you to all the staff for everything you do. We cant wait to go back again soon",
            "My wife and I travelled with our daughter, son i law and twin 4 year old grandchildren. Holiday started off on a bad note following Thai Airways decision to cancel our return flight before we left Australia. Rebooked for the next available flight which necessitated an extra two day stay. Welcome by GOs Preyne and Apple and a few words by Resort Manager Vincent was good. First impression of our Deluxe room was that it was clean but a bit dated probably because of the old fashioned brown wood everywhere. We were aware of the Thai Government requirement to stay in our rooms until we all got a covid test (taken at PhuketAirport on arrival) negative report. Unfortunately, we received the news late at night that one of the twins had tested positive. We soon became aware of what was to become a major problem. The Resort had no plans in place for this situation. There was a basic snack menu which we utilised that night but there was no main meal menu and, basically, room service was chaotic. One of the GOs Preyne took it on herself to assist us and organised photos of food to be sent to us which helped. A menu with half a dozen options was forthcoming a few days later but the meals were always only Luke warm. During our period of lockdown we had very poor TV reception, wet bathroom floors due to what appeared to be faulty air conditioning and I personally got a bad back from spending time sleeping, lying or sitting on the bed. I must stress that at all times the GOs and all staff were brilliant. After a few days the food and alcohol (some beers and bottle of wine) delivery times improved greatly. What greatly impressed us was the fact that we were able to obtain freedom to enjoy the Resort activities, restaurants, bars, pools, kids club, etc. During our lockdown we were in touch with the Australian Consulate who had meetings at the Thai Embassy and it was clear that the Embassy was inundated with calls from Resorts and Hotels who requested direction on covid cases. In summarising, ClubMed and the Resort was at fault for firstly not thoroughly checking that everything works in the rooms following a two year closure plus not having a plan to deal with covid cases in room quarantine. Once they got their act together the holiday was great with unbelievable activities and fantastic staff (one of the Manages, I think Housekeeping, even bought the twins a couple of little cars to play with) plus we saw a very visible resort manager out and about checking on things. We all live and learn during these difficult times. In the end we are grateful to ClubMed and a strong Travel Agent at itravel, Wonoona for offering us the extra 2 days free at the Resort plus a future 3 free days at any ClubMed resort in Asia. Would I recommend ClubMed Phuket? Yes.",
            "Hubby and I have been to Club Med Phuket before (pre-kids) and we absolutely loved it. When we had our daughter we knew exactly where we wanted to spend her first birthday but sadly covid hit and we had to reschedule but it was well worth the wait. So 2.5 years later and another baby in tow we finally had our much deserved family holiday. Since Covid, Club Med Phuket had time to do some renovations so it was lovely to see some upgrades since we had last been there. We were worried about having a toddler and a baby there but we had nothing to worry about, the staff were so lovely and accomodating with the kids. Upon arrival Apple greeted us with a warm welcome, she has a special way of making her guests feel welcome at the resort. When we arrived at our room, we found everything beautifully set up, there were sea creates made out of towels on our beds and even some baby bath items were placed in the porta cot, all just a lovely touch after a long flight. Our daughter joined the petite club for a couple of days too and the staff there were just fantastic. Our baby was the star of the show and everybody loved him, thank you to Abu and the chef for always making sure that he had some baby food at meals times. When you travel with your kids you get access to the baby corner which was super helpful in-between meal times, the fridge was stocked with purees, milk and yogurt which the kids loved. The waitering staff were fantastic with both the kids, so friendly and fun, my daughter especially loved the attention. If you have ever been to a Club Med then you know that the GO's are there to socialise with you and we were very lucky to have met a few outstanding people that will forever be etched into our hearts. For one Jack from the bar, he must be the kindest soul we have ever met, our daughter loved him and we loved sharing meals with him and learning more about him too. Then there is Rere from amazing families, our daughter took a special liking to her, she called her teacher and whenever Rere was around, there our daughter would be too, there were lots of tears on departure that's for sure! As a bonus our time there fell on my birthday and the staff went out of their way to make it special for you. From the cleaning staff who did up our room with flowers to the kitchen staff who made a cake and to everyone else who came round to sing happy birthday, it really made it one to remember. If ever lucky enough to go to this resort, be sure to go to the Spa, this was an incredible experience, my massage lady was so friendly and made me feel so comfortable, (hubby even fell asleep during his treatment) Thank you to everyone who worked during our time at Club Med Phuket, this was really a holiday to remember and so many beautiful memories were made. We always highly recommend Club Med for the convenience of everything, it's truly all-inclusive, all you need to do is relax and enjoy! I would only recommend a portable clothing rack be placed in the rooms, when travelling with kids there is always a lot of wet things but no where to hang this up. it would be so handy to have this available.",
            "Our first Club Med holiday, probably not our last. Warm welcome and friendly team from the moment we arrived through to our final day. The resort is huge, beachside (crystal water and white sand when we visited) and beautifully landscaped, maintained and cleaned. The activities and events are plentiful, well organised and a lot of fun for all ages to try new experiences and be as active (or inactive) as you like each day. Special mention and thanks from our family to: the whole Circus team (their warmth and professionalism meant we definitely left our limits at home and their evening pool performance was breathtaking); Marieta for our super sweet welcome and fun at the tennis centre; Xoli for her beautiful gentle strength and smile in the abs, aqua and stretching sessions; and Abu for consistently attentive and friendly service in the restaurant. The all-inclusive price is very good value as the food is really excellent and varied and the drinks keep flowing!",
            "four families went on a trip to club med phuket during the school holidays. The children enjoyed the activities very much. The spread of food at the main restaurant was great, good spread, decent quality, free flow and well replenished except for the macaroons(too popular i guess). the seats are almost always available. The fish somehow was always badly cooked. The was this supposedly better restaurant which u can book to dine at Chu Da Restaurant. Haiz, it's a disappointment and its quite a distance away. You can give it a miss. It only have better setup, sometimes the aircon isn't working and you are dining and sweating. The bun was cold, the food was so so, wld rather eat in main restaurant. There isn't much outside the facilities, except for a massage and 7-11 and pharmacy and a few local restaurants. No night mkt due to bad tourism during covid. There is special trapeze shows on friday nite, where u need to buy a bottle of wine/champaign in order to enjoy front row show in front of the pool. The beach in front of the resort is decently clear without strong waves, not very suitable for surfing probably due to the time of the year. It's clean overall, no poaching or sorts. Overall its enjoyable.",
            "I have returned to Club Med Phuket several times and this GO team was by far the best I have ever experienced. The instructors from Golf (Zandile) and Tennis (Josh) were patient and knew how to have fun, whilst teaching their sport. The sports team (especially Kuga) were so much fun. As a solo traveler the kindness and company of many of the GO's made this trip so wonderful. Mention must go to Felix (training manager) who was always ready on the dance floor with a smile. The housekeeping team, namely Yupa was very friendly and bent over backwards to meet my every need. The CDV Geoffrey and his assistant Maxime have enough energy to go around and this became infectious with all the other guests. This holiday was truly amazing due to the wonderful people that shared their cultures, friendship and stories. The location is perfect and with this combination of staff, I have already booked to return!",
            "We wanted a chilled beach side accommodation with a fuss free itinerary during our mini-moon, so we choose Club Med Phuket since we had a fantastic experience in Cherating. Booked the normal room but since we were on our honeymoon, we had the room decorated and had a set of couple tees! The rooms were so clean and newly renovated BUT it took us very long to get back to our room as it was at the furtherest end shortcut is 7mins, long cut is because of being sheltered, 15mins. It was quiet and very clean. However, the experience was a little different in Phuket. We didn't get the similar treatment that we got in other Club Med resort and it felt like the G.O.s sideline the Asian guests more than the Caucasian ones. I spoke to the restaurant waitress more than the G.O. to be honest. Some just passed us without greeting us. Activities wise, thankfully they had our fav archery! They too had Muay Thai classes but because we had another appointment with the spa, so it clashed And there was no mention of you need to be there at the beginning of the activity, so we missed it twice. I would be good to have that mentioned in the app. I also joined their pilates classes, the room had everything and the instructor was really good. The Trapeze was very fun and oddly enough not many guest wanted to try it. There were lotsa indoor games, pool table, ping pong and some quizzes that you could join in when it rained. The beach was next to the hotel but due to rain we didn't go and we thought we had time before we checked out. The tidal waves were strong on rainy days The weather was unpredictable there as we lost 1 day for snorkelling that we had to catch up on the day we checked out. But the duration for the snorkeling activity did not make sense. You had to travel 15min drive + 40 mins boat ride to and fro the location that you only get 30mins to play. In total travel 2.2 hours but to play around 30mins? I really think the journey was really too long. It would had been nice if the resort provided us some snacks after the session, we were pretty hungry during the long journey back. We had a massage session in Club Med and it was by far the cheapest massage I ever saw in ANY hotel/resort and when we checked out I missed it so much Hiroko, our front desk staff (or called G.O.) was very accommodating to our needs and helped us booked the snorkelling and dinner sessions."

            "Weve returned from an 8 night stay at The Slate and wish we were back there! We didnt want to leave. The hotel is absolutely stunning and ticks every single box (maybe apart from air con in some of the communal areas but this would spoil the open air theme of the hotel) We booked a pool room as we were celebrating a big birthday. The room was superb and well placed between pools 2 & 3. Arrival was very quick and informative with a lovely glass of something to drink, not sure what it was but it was lush and a worst corsages for the ladies. The bed in the room is so comfortable and the rooms are spotless, maid visits around 6pm to fill the mosquito coil, cleans away used towels, draws the curtains, our maid was so lovely. The hotel has a stock room where you can buy some of the Slate products, I loved the smell of the shower/bath items that I bought some to bring home as a constant reminder. I thought this was a great touch. We ate and drank a fair bit in the hotel. Used the pool bar several times, River and Rebar and Black Ginger, we also used in house dining and the food was spot on every time. Black Ginger was a gorgeous experience, food was outstanding as was the service. We felt we wanted to try more food but didnt have the time ! Food is obviously more expensive than outside the hotel but is definitely worth it, Id say the prices were comparable to a good meal in the UK but of a far better standard we were very surprised by our bill on check out which included a Phi Phi tour. The pools are gorgeous and so quiet, water is a plenty from the lovely pool guys as well as fruit and cold towels which always made my morning. we tended to use pool 3 but had used pool 2 with the swim up bar. The hotel is spotless and just feels like an oasis of calm at all times, it was the most relaxing holiday Ive been on, particularly in a large hotel, it was full at the time but you would have never have guessed. I felt totally relaxed after the trip. We used some of the bars and restaurants outside the hotel which were all really good, nothing stood out particularly but the staff again are all lovely and welcoming. We were invited to the cocktail party where you get to meet staff and other guests and enjoy free flow drinks and canaps. We met Sao from food and beverages and a guy from IT, both were lovely and talked about how they enjoyed working at The Slate. This was a lovely touch I felt. I couldnt recommend this hotel any more, its just amazing and we cant wait to return. Close and convenient for the airport too. Literally 5 minutes. Many thanks to all the staff who made my birthday the most enjoyable memorable experience. We will be back !",
            "My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon and had the most amazing time! The food was all so delicious, the pool was the perfect temperature and clean, the staff were all so helpful and accommodating, and the resort is full of beautiful luscious green everywhere. The location of the slate is PERFECT. Its a minute drive from the airport, and its located directly in front of Naiyang beach. We had a lot of fun walking the beach every morning, going to the food stalls during the evening, and enjoying some of the bars after! It was the perfect location full of lots to do! We went to the spa twice during our stay and had the most relaxing time. We did the Mr. and Mrs. package so we had a massage, a facial, and a milk bath our first time and then our second time we did a body wrap and lymphatic massage. All of them were very comfortable and we would recommend. We also experienced the vitamin drip at Kru one morning, and the staff were so helpful and calming. My husband and I felt incredible after having this done! The front desk was so helpful in arranging travel for us to go out for plans we had made and covid tests we had to take. It took all of the stress out of figuring out how we would get anywhere, which was SO NICE! They were very helpful when it came to recommending the best markets to visit or things to do on the way to something we had planned already so we werent wasting any time! My husband and I reserved both the romantic private dinner and the chefs table experience. They were both INCREDIBLE! For our romantic dinner we had a bottle of champagne with a table covered in rose petals and a 4 course dinner that we basically licked the plate clean! They set us up in one of their suites because it was supposed to rain, and wow it was so beautiful and romantic. The chefs table experience we would highly recommend as well as it was 4 courses that took place in 4 different rooms! It was such a neat experience to have a change of scenery each course. The chef made incredible food both nights and we were NOT disappointed! We stayed in the private pool resort and it was our perfect oasis when we needed some time for us. There were punkawalla fans that you could turn on and it would keep you perfectly comfortable while enjoying a drink on the patio. We would definitely stay in one of these again! We had the most perfect honeymoon and a lot of it was spent just enjoying time at the resort and Naiyang beach. There is so much here to do and enjoy, we would recommend staying here to anyone! We cant wait to come back again sometime soon!",
            "The hotel is stunning. From the designer interior to the friendly staff who will bend over backwards at a drop of a hat to help you - staying here is luxury at its best. Whilst the hotel is located at the pristine Nai Yang Beach & National Park which has the whitest of sands and clearest of waters to enjoy, it the hotel which whisks you away to luxury settings. There's a choice of 3 pools (including an adults only pool with a sunken pool bar to indulge in during their 'no rush' hour), the mind-blowing Black Ginger restaurant which you can only enter via raft and the hotel will also provide you with private BBQ dining on the beach to enjoy the sunset whilst your feet are in the sand. For the level of service, comfort and overall experience, it's great value for money and frankly, it's the only place to stay if you're in Phuket!",
            "We stayed at the Slate for a week towards the end of Feb prior to picking up a cruise (an odyssey for another time). I booked the hotel nearly a year in advance and chose a pool suite for the privacy. Coronavirus was beginning to spread outside of China so we were keeping an eye on Government advice and that given by our travel agent who said it was business as usual from both the airlines and hotels. Nothing adverse from our cruise company either so off we went. We arrived at the hotel mid morning and we greeted by very friendly staff who booked us in and as the room wasnt quite ready we enjoyed a lovely cold drink while a very pleasant Irish lady who was part of the management team explained all about the hotel. Thailand is very popular with Chinese tourists and because of the lockdown in China they were missing so occupancy was well down although they reckoned it was at 75%. Once we were settled in and after a few days we noticed the only large congregation of people was at breakfast. We ate at all 3 restaurants none of which were full at any time. The food was very tasty but was overpriced as was the wine mainly imported from NZ. Because of the islands tin mining past the design of the hotel is very industrial with factory type plumbing, metal surfaces with plenty of rivets on show. A shabby chic look with some places more shabby than chic ! Plenty of metal sculptures in the grounds too. The hotel occupies a large area with lovely gardens which were well manicured. Dotted around were 3 pools with adequate loungers, shade and towels and waiters on hand for drinks etc. Our pool suite was at the far end of the grounds a 2 minute walk away from a very sparsely populated beach but nonetheless plenty of bars around for drinks and snacks. The suite had a walk in shower, separate toilet and outdoor bath. The bed was very comfortable, complimentary water replenished every day as was the usual shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. Our only issue was with the pool which was in shade for most of the day apart from early morning and the odd 30 minutes throughout the day which was so disappointing and defeated the object of booking such a suite in the first place. It was all down to the design. The building was ground floor and one above. The room above had its own balcony but running off the balcony over the shallow end of our pool was a slatted roof feature which shaded us. At the far end of our pool was a very large pitched roof covering which combined with the branches of a tree in the garden and the slatted roof of our upstairs neighbour guaranteed very little sun in our garden. Definitely not worth paying the extra money. Ending on a positive note, the staff were very warm and friendly and nothing was too much trouble.",
            "We really wanted to love this place. The architecture and art are very different for Thailand. The rooms are large and comfortable. Sadly, where this hotel fails is in the service. The pool bars had five staff hanging around and no one seemed interested in serving anyone. They passed water only once a day - the rest of the time you had to go to the towel station to get your own water. By day three, we stopped tolerating poorly mixed drinks and simply getting the wrong order and sent them back. In a period of 1.5 hours, four drinks were sent back and only two correct. We also ate at the Japanese restaurant. Again, there were about four staff working on our table, but only one that really paid us attention. We ordered two bottles of white wine to go with our dinner - first bottle served warm, so we asked them to start icing the second bottle prior to serving. We ended up having to pour our own wine from the second bottle because the main waitress disappeared, and the other three just stood around. We made use of our one free drink, and could only order from a separate menu for the welcome drink. I dont think there was any alcohol it them at all. We also found that if you liked a particular cocktail served at one bar on the resort, you couldnt actually order it at another bar on the property. Finally, we considered using the spa. We went to the spa reception and asked if there were any specials. Nope, nada, none at all. We left to decide by the pool what services we might want to experience and low and behold, we are approached by a spa staffer telling us about a discounted offer available today. Hmmm. Where was that 10 minutes ago when we were actually at the spa??? For the price and hype of this hotel, we expected to have a lot better service.",
            "I cannot rave about this hotel more. The staff made it for us. The hotel itself is beautiful and decorated with such an eye for detail, it's truly stunning. However, even with all of this beauty, the hotel is made truly special by the staff who work there. Every single waiter, waitress, receptionist, cleaner, gardener or babysitter we came across was so polite and friendly. Staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and enjoying ourselves. We stayed with our 18 month old daughter and she was adored and given so much attention. We had a really special time here and I would come back like a shot. And, I haven't even begun to talk about how delicious the food was... Thank you so much for having us. It was perfect.",
            "Stayed for two weeks in April weather was fantastic very hot with a little rain some evenings. Location is fantastic away from the busy tourist hotspots but only a taxi ride away if you want a lively evening. The beach is beautiful with lovely bars and restaurants situated in the sand, we spent most days at the hotel then went over to the beach and had a gin and tonic and watched the most beautiful sunsets every evening. Food at the hotel is the best Ive ever had at a hotel and we have stayed at lots of resorts. My fussy teenage son ate lots of different foods. Breakfast was amazing. We had the D-buk suite which was a great size. Large walk in wardrobe and large well designed rooms the second bed had a curtain so our son and us had some privacy. We would of liked to have spent time at the swim up bar but jnforyiver 16s only. I think it would be better to allow mature children or over 14s the second pool was also over 14s and we spent lots of time here. The main large pool was also great. Slate, one of your staff members Ian who walks around the pools and waits on your guests is a credit to your company, he really made our stay very enjoyable and made sure we were never thirsty, he also always made a effort with our son who is a West Ham united fan and Ian knew lots about them. Looking forward to visiting again.",
            "We stayed here for 9 nights in January 2020. The resort is huge and it takes a while to get your bearings. It caters for all travellers. The three pools are all great. We mainly went to pool 3, the quieter infinity pool where Ian looked after us really well, keeping us hydrated and pampered with cooling cloths and pineapple skewers for refreshment. We ate at all of the restaurants. Black Ginger is a great experience and has a fabulous ambience. The food in the Japanese restaurant Rivet was probably the best on offer. It was a pity there weren't more guests in the restaurants, for atmosphere. This is probably because the restaurants are fairly expensive by local standards. Maybe a reduction in prices would encourage people to eat in the hotel rather than the other local restaurants. The local restaurants where we ate were all good. The staff in general were really helpful and friendly, particularly the breakfast crew. Breakfast itself had everything you could want, and their croissants were exceptional. Everywhere was spotlessly clean and well maintained. We really enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",
            "So first the good points. This is a lovely quirky property and the design is fab. Although some of the landscaping could use some work and also the maintenance of it. Secondly my kids loved the kids club particularly Pui, so massive thanks to her! Now the downside. Iv never really encountered a hotel who are worse at communicating with you than the slate. I emailed the hotel regarding some requests prior to our visit and got no response, so tried again a week later and finally got a response from Nawaporn who wasnt particularly helpful at all, and then even to get replies back to further emails from her took over a week, I then even had to call the hotel to chase! Which is completely not on! Service is key when it comes to looking after your guests! I requested some things for my toddlers for our room eg kids toilet seat, stool for the sink which were not ready and we then had to ask three different people on arrival. I had also arranged a transfer with the the hotel as we were getting off a 14 hour journey in the hope that we would have no wait time and would be taken straight to our hotel. When we got to arrivals we couldnt find a representative from the hotel, when we finally did the car was not ready as they had forgotten the car seats! So we were waiting for another 15 minutes in the heat with a 2 & 4 year old. Completely not on as this service is about 3x the price of a regular taxi from the airport! The slate if you read this at this moment we are still here in room 2110 and you have a last chance to redeem yourselves. I am an independent travel agent and I know what good service and hospitality is and this is not it!!! Most hotels cant do enough to show you the best that they have to offer, definitely not the the case here.",
            "We just come back from Thailand (phuket), we stayed at The Slate for 7days and absolutely loved it. The people and services and absolutely wonderful. It more of a tropical hotel so the beach isn't at your door step if you like that, you have to walk out of the hotel to go to the beach. Which we did not mind because the the hotel tropical tree and flowers are beautiful. The food is amazing I didn't have one bad experience with food, they have three restaurants on site so you have a lot of choice even for vegetarians. But the most amazing part are the staff they are amazing they are so friendly even to the rude customer who think they own the world. They recommend so many places to go and see and do they immediately informed us that we may it things cheaper if we went somewhere else rather an where most tourists would go to, but only go there if you like local markets. They hotel is self is clean they decorated it like contemporary art and you so no white tales and clean lines which is the beauty of the hotel. I loved that they had floor boards and no carpet and tiles it actually made feel clean. House keeping are amazing so if some extra just ask. If have kids I would recommend asking for a ground floor room it would be easier. But if your look for a different kind of hotel with 5 star experience then give The Slate a chance and you want be disappointed. Have lovely holiday."
