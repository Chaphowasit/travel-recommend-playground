            "We had a fantastic time at Karon! The beach was beautiful, and the atmosphere was so relaxing. Great for a peaceful getaway. Highly recommend visiting!",
            "This beautiful beach is for people looking for water activities and sports. The beach is ver clean and the water is very clean. one good place to visit.",
            "The beach beautiful and good location very very good view i stayed here Chanalai hillside resort i walk to the beach -7 minutes good the beach",
            "One of the most enchanting n beautiful sandy beaches I have ever experienced. We have seen the sun set in this sandy beach .",
            "Lacks atmosphere and 90% eastern block tourists who seem ti never smile ,so not sure if they're enjoying their stay or it could be the heat. The whole Karon area needs a makeover.",
            "Lovely beach, clean. Sunbeds and umbrellas 200 bhat for 2. Sea choppy with rips when we were there in April. Im not confident in the sea so a bit disappointing as only stayed near the shore.",
            "Spent a couple weeks here with family. Stayed in hotel , 5 minute walk to north side of beach.. We loved this beach, the powder sugary like sands are awesome. Sands do get hot so if off surf lines youll need sandals. Beach chairs with umbrella set ups are great and plentiful, cost only 200 baht a day for two chairs and anchored umbrella.. lots of sun and heat here, cover is necessity. During our stay, surf was low to moderate in a few days, great swimming, water fun here. Great snorkelling as well in this end to north shore lines.. Easy walk from here to food and convenience stores.. cabs and tuk tuks nearby. This beach has lots of water activities available for fees as well. We found it quiet, clean and comfortable. Not one issue with annoying music or intrusions. Found this beach way superior to Patong where we stayed prior.",
            "Good beach with too many jellyfish which makes it difficult to swim in. Me & my kid ended up swimming in the hotel pool! Of course much better than patong, but overall pretty average. May be, this month (March) is jellyfish season as one of our guide said that jellyfish come out in summers more than in winters..not sure..but pls plan carefully!",
            "We had been looking at this beach from a far all day from different high viewpoints in Phuket. With how green the water looked from a far I thought that it would be turquoise water when we got there. It wasnt. There are no facilities(showers or bathrooms) that we could see. We set up at the far left if looking at the water where the sun chairs are at to rent. 4 chairs and 2 umbrellas was 400 baht. The sand was extremely hot, so bring some water shoes. The water was like bathtub temps. I could see where that would seem nice, but we were hoping for a cooler dip based off the heat outside. The water color up close was nothing to write home about.",
            "Clean and beautiful. Definitely worth the visit, a lot cleaner than patong beach, water is much nicer at Karon. Worth hiring chairs."

            "Much quieter than Kata Beach, less sellers and the beach was clean and peaceful. You could buy cold drinks and there was the few people selling nuts and corn and few other things being sold. We hired a body board for 100 baht for an hour and 2 recliners with umbrella for 200 baht and you could stay all day on them if you wanted. We loved it!!",
            "We didnt like this beach at all. Sadly its very crowded when we went and there were red flags saying that jelly fish are around.. we did saw lots of jelly fish in the sand and couple of pupper fish as well. The toilet facilities were very dirty.",
            "Beautiful beach, so much quieter and cleaner than Kata Beach. Great snorkeling at the southern end and also bar selling reasonably priced drinks. Snorkeling gear for hire. 2 Sunbeds and an umbrella 200 baht a day.",
            "Great beach location just 30 minutes from Phuket Old Town. We used Grab to gte there. Lots of street food shops arround. Yes!",
            "Beautiful sandy beach with crystal clear water! This beach was our favourite out of the few we visited during our 3 week stay at Kata Noi! Plenty of sun beds available - we favoured the south end near the rocks for snorkelling with the fish. We had about 3 days of jellyfish causing a little problem with swimming, so just kept out of the water. My thoughts were, that they were here first - we are invading their home! This end of the beach is also a little quieter, with a great little fresh juice bar tucked up in the rocks under the shade of trees! A handful of small shacks dotted along this smaller sized beach, offer basic food & fresh fruit juices, as well as the beach massage to unwind with after a busy day of chilling! Unfortunately, a little rubbish here & there left by people who just dont seem to care! A little more untidy by the steps, at the north end of the beach, but in comparison, less than other beaches we visited! We certainly felt this beach gave us the best overall vibe, as didnt have the hustle & bustle of a larger beach! Kata Noi is a no through small town so is much quieter than even Kata beach, the next beach up.",
            "Loved this beach more than kata and karon beach, makmly because I didn't see a single jellyfish on this beach or in the water. We found this beach while hiring motorbikes and driving round, as such we entered the beach at the top near the motorbike parking and that was a lot of steep steps down to the beach, hopefully there is a less steep option further down the hill. Water was wonderfully clear, no snorkel mask needed to see small fish. Nice white sand, a fair few sunbeds to chill on.",
            "Our day at this wonderful beach spot was pure bliss! From dawn to dusk, we soaked in the sun and surf, surrounded by the warmth of smiling faces. A perfect escape with positive vibes all around!",
            "Kata Noi is a beautiful little stretch of beach, just over the hill from the main Kata beach. I was hoping it would be a little bit more hidden and quiet, but it seems to have developed quite quickly over the years and isn't a \"best kept secret\" type of place as I've seen it described other places. But nevertheless, clear, calm water, super soft sand and some fun entry level snorkeling for the kids down by the south end near the rocks. Still beautiful and fun, but feels as busy as Kata main and Karon.",
            "The beach was extremely packed and the water felt as if its been reused throughout the whole of Thailand; Warm, stagnant and cloudy. The sand on the other hand, even worse. It clung to me the whole day and even ended up in my hotel bed. Very unhappy with this experience, will not be returning swiftly. Avoid at all costs.",
            "just found the best market in kata noi. Really like seafood here and the cocktail choice. On the day I visited,there are a cabaret show and live music as well."

            "An extremely overpriced and underwhelming show best avoided unless you have a toddler in the group. My daughter( 3 years) liked the fairies, the jumbos and the hens but the show is of 30 -40 mins. The buffet is horrible to say the least, a few colourful shops but if you have been to other kids entertainment parks e.g. disney/ universal etc there's not a lot to see other than that 30 mins show. There are a few photo ops sbut are quite expensive - at 1900 bht ticket (sgd 83) its more than what i pay for the universal ( sgd 75) and its no match.",
            "An expensive and over-hyped place. Not to much to scout around in the place. Main attraction is the dinner and the event at the end. There are not to many options in veg/ non-veg (chicken based) though Youtubers show huge dining hall but variety is limited. Other than water nothing comes free, everything is for charges payable there. Deserts are limited, Ice-Cream is against payent",
            "The show was fantastic. The buffet meal prior to the show was very average. My advice would be eat prior and arrive later to watch the show. The park is full of arcade games, souvenir shops, photo opportunities.everything that you need to pay extra for. We were annoyed with the fact that you had to wait around in the heat or spend money prior to the show starting after already spending a large amount on the actual entrance tickets.",
            "Started 3 hours before show from Hotel. Price of ticket included Dinner. We ordered Vegetarian Dinner. Table Arrangements was good, but food on Counter was not upto mark for such a nice show. Food at such dinners should be of more varieties. No drinks, or Deserts were there except few cut fruits and Sweet coconut Jelly and pastries. As pastries might be containing eggs, Vegetarians avoid eating pastries. Icecream was there but chargeable extra. We felt cheated for such ordinary Dinner wasting two hours. Most of time was passed in souvenirs shops. Show theme story was not impressive, except highlight of show ELEPHANTS being brought on stage. That's only impressive item in show. After show, collecting Mobiles and shopping bags deposited earlier was again an issue of time wasting with mob. Looking to charges including Dinner, better avoid dinner, and go for show only if permitted.",
            "The ambience was excellent. The performers were not so synchronized. For the price charged the performers must be well rehersed, which was not. The food was below average. I am a vegetarian. So the options available was limited, and was tasteless.",
            "So much animal abuse my heart breaks. Dont go if you like animals or have a heart in your chest. People who like this are just soulless creatures. If you dare search on internet what they do to the animals to make this happen. Look at their similar scars it tells a story.. search on internet breaking of the soul elephants you will never go to elephant shows again",
            "Everyone who thinks this is a fun show has no soul in their body. This is pure animal abuse it was to painful to watch. The elephants all have the same scars and looked extremely depressed. In order to let them do the tricks they have to break down the spirit of the elephant please look it up on google. Dont go here if you dont want to watch pure suffering",
            "The show itself is amazing until elephants perform their tricks. Why?????? It has no context to the story being told, and while the elephants are clever, it leaves you to wonder what they have to go through to learn the routine. Also, the tiger was walking around in a small box even though very brief again why.... Buffet mediocre. When you have drinks, they are pestering you to pay even though you are obviously eating... The venue is lovely even though shopping is more expensive than elsewhere. Very mixed feelings. As said, show itself is fantastic, acrobats amazing, but wish they'd cut down on animal usage.",
            "The location and ambiance is ok. The show is very average. The dinner is not worth the money. You can give it a miss if you have visited Kindom of Dreams at Gurugram,India. This is just 10% of it.",
            "So so sad.. we were so excited to go not really looking into what it was but soon as we got there we seen the elephants who looked so so sad then went through to the show and we were just sick all the way through. The show itself was good enough without all the animals brought on stage.. Im so glad Im from the UK and anything like this would not stand! I feel so bad I contributed to the animals abuse and definitely will be visiting the elephant sanctuary again before I leave and donating some money as like I say I just feel sick to the stomach and this will be on my mind heavily now Also just to add not just the elephants but all the animals they used were just totally unnecessary . You have to ask yourself why they dont allow phones into the theatre.. As no one would go!! We wish we would have read the reviews before going plus its not cheap!"

Excellent support before, during and after diving from divemaster/instructor Mr Pae. He was very helpful and during three days of diving, he assisted and helped in the best possible way. I really appreciated the diving in Phuket, and I give give Merlin Divers my best recommendations.",
            "We booked a days diving with Merlin Divers while stopping in Kamala Beach. Robert was easy to deal with and we were booked in to do a days diving off the Phi Phi Islands for the day. We were picked up from our hotel without any issues and transferred to the dock to meet the day boat. The boat was busy but comfortable and after 2 hours we were ready for the 1st dive. Our dive guide Mr Pae set up our gear(which was good quality) for us each dive and after checking we were ready to go. The visibility wasnt so good on all 3 dives but that can change on a daily basis so it cant be helped. We had 3 good dives though still though and would recommend Merlin Divers to all by diver friends if diving in Phuket.",
            "We went diving with Merlin Divers and had amazing dives. The shop owner Robert informed us about all the trips and we felt very well prepared. Under water we enjoyed ourselfes and afterwards we got to talk about all the different animals and corals we saw. Would definetely recommend!",
            "This being my first scuba diving experience was challenge, I have snorkel before so my thoughts was I be ok . The drivers that took us on an incredible underwater tour explaining how and why made it a charming process . There was 6 of us , 3 that had many dives and doing their open water certificate, 3 including me that had fear about it healthy fear of course . Ending of my reviews are please go out with this diving company, omg an experience you must have on holidays. Kindest regards Craig Hand 0415 614 712",

            "My 11-year-old son and I wanted to get our PADI open water certificates, and we booked with Merlin. We were assigned to Ulysses as our dive master, and he was a great teacher! Very patient and informative! We saw some beautiful fish on four different dives, and we would definitely recommend this company and Ulysses if you want to learn to scuba dive.",
            "Merlin Divers is one of the best. Setting up the trip at the last minute, organizing exactly the type of dive I was looking for was made super easy by Robert's attentive and thoughtful recommendations. Could not recommend more highly.",
            "A couple of months before my trip, I sent a few emails to Robert. I got a quick and professional response. When I arrived, Robert helped me to organise dives for my entire holiday. I had great dives in Kamala and many other sides. Roberts team has great attitude. On the boat was a great atmosphere. Divemasters are very professional and friendly. I would not hesitate to recommend Merlin Divers to anyone.",
            "Merlin Divers Phuket is a fantastic place with a inviting atmosphere. The owner and dive masters/instructors are incredibly welcoming and professional, making every dive experience enjoyable and safe. I highly recommend this dive center for anyone looking to explore the underwater world in Phuket!",
            "I arranged a 3-day open water diving course for me and my girlfriend very easily with Robert and he was really helpful and responsive. Our course was primarily led by Ulysse who was an absolutely fantastic instructor. We felt in very safe hands and thought he had a great style of teaching and was just a really nice guy! Everything went seamlessly and was expertly organised and all of the equipment we needed was provided. I would give my experience with Merlin Divers a 10/10 and would absolutely recommend them. In addition, our 4 dives were so much fun and we saw lots of sea life. We are both so happy to now be qualified!"

Thank you for creating memories of a life time. The picture you took of all of us will grace our walls at home so we can remember the moments and the people that contributed to the experience. We hope anyone that reads this can decide on Simba. Its definitely worth the early start.",

            "Highly recommended . We just finished the Koh phi phi sunrise tour and it was amazing. Every thing was well planned and high quality. The staff was amazing. We have a disabled son and Joe and the boat crew helped us with getting him in and out of the boat. I appreciate it very much There are many tour groups to choose from but Simba does an excellent job. You cant get wrong",
            "One of the best experiences I have had during my entire Thailand tour. The team is highly professional, and the tour was very well curated leaving no stone unturned. Not to miss that they pick you from your hotel and the backend support team is very responsive and never leaves you unanswered. Starting from the quality of the transport they provide, or the quality food and specially would like to highlight our tour guide Ms. Momo as she was exceptionally good. Doesn't matter if you are travelling alone or with family or with kid, they very well know how to take care of you. My compliments to the whole team !!!! and a big thank you for giving such a memorable experience !!!! :-)",
            "Incredible excursion for those interested in going island hopping. Pick up is around 5am from your hotel, followed by an introduction at the marina and then a 1.25 hour speed boat trip out to the islands. The crew was incredibly friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. Big shoutout to Dee who led the charge and helped make the day memorable. Would do this again next time we're in Phuket.",
            "A must see and do during your Phuket visit if you want to see the Phi Phi Islands. I recommend this tour if you want to avoid the overall crowds and dont mind waking up super early for hotel pick up, you wont regret it, first ones on the island. So worth having a smaller group rather than larger crowd. Harry, our tour guide was gracious and fed us yummy snacks, baked bread and a wonderful lunch at the end of the tour. The views were amazing. All the boat staff were lovely and helpful. Thank you Simba Tours.",
            "Our group of 6 all loved this trip (ranging from 50 to 7 years old)! The sunrise, early arrival to Maya Bay beating the crowds, top notch snorkeling, all of it was just perfect! The small group size was a big selling point for me as well and Momo and her crew were simply awesome. After several weeks traveling in Thailand, this ranked top of the list of our excursions for myself and the kids.",
            "If youre debating whether or not to book a tour through them, the answer is YES! My fianc and I took the sunrise boat tour of Phi Phi Islands and it was absolutely incredible. The crew was amazing! Kind, friendly, knowledgeable- everything you could hope for. They stopped at all the best spots, staying for the perfect amount of time in each location. The boat was small enough to have a more personalized experience, yet big enough that you didnt feel the (at times) rough seas. 10/10 recommend!",
            "The Simba sunrise tour was fabulous, well worth the early morning pick up time & definitely worth doing this tour!! So much delicious food from the breakfast at the marina to breakfast and one of the first to arrive at Maya bay so early in the morning. Snacks and drinks along the way & a beautiful Thai lunch back at the pool club! Snorkelling with baby sharks & so many nemo fish was a highlight!! Everything was so well organised. Huge thanks to MoMo, the captain and crew for getting us safely back to the pool club for a delicious lunch after the weather took an unexpected turn. They were all so professional and caring - thanks moMo for the head and neck massage - you are all amazing!!! It was great to spend the day with such a terrific small group of people from around the world - so much fun!!",
            "Outstanding small group excursion! Cant say enough about every bit of this tour. Fresh fruit, cold drinks, lovely Thai hospitality, perfect for a solo traveler. Hotel pick up was seamless, with attention to detail superb! The Thai lunch was a real treat!"

Their response was prompt and accommodating, and before I knew it, everything was arranged seamlessly. We were fortunate to have the dive shop owner, Edo, as our guide, who went above and beyond to ensure our experience was nothing short of spectacular. Not only did he pick us up from across town, but his relaxed demeanor and expertise made the dives an absolute delight. And talk about luck during our dive, we had the incredible opportunity to encounter a Leopard Shark and a massive Manta Ray! But the excitement didn't end there; while on the boat, we were treated to the unforgettable sight of four Minky whales.

            "WOW! EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME. Elephant Jungle Sanctuary has 4 sites around Thailand. At this site, they have rescued 6 adult elephants from logging and the entertainment industry. Each elephant has their own caretaker and the love/respect they show these animals is impressive. We did the half day experience. Got to feed the elephants lots of watermelon. Then we gave them a mud bath. Bring a swimsuit so you can get in the mud, swimming hole and showers with the elephants. Bring dry clothes. The shower/bathroom facilities are very clean. Getting right up to the elephants without bars or fences was unbelievable. They are such magnificent, gentle creatures. Kevin and Eddie were warm, friendly and so personable. Great instruction on how to interact with the elephants. They took lots of photos/videos with our cameras. They also took beautiful photos you can download from Facebook. Lunch was also delicious. You would think this was just an afterthought. Not here. Tasty pad Thai chicken, Tom Yum Gai (chicken soup with coconut milk) and sweet/sour chicken. Highly recommend for anyone who loves animals and wants to experience elephants up close and personal.",
            "First and foremost the compassion, kindness and education on elephant welfare is paramount at this sanctuary. From feeding, photos and swimming with the elephants this day was unforgettable! Annie and Eddie provided an engaging and funny guide to the morning.

We fed the elephants, went to the mud pool and then to a deeper pool with them Also had a great buffet lunch to end the day Highly recommended",
            "We went for the half day experience .. our guide Annie was amazing , she gave us lots of information about how they care for the elephants ; we fed them and watched as they absolutely had so much fun bathing .. We were invited to join in with experiences and Annie brought so much fun to our visit . Thank You We also need to mention Hannah and our photographer for making our visit so enjoyable. Well worth a visit to support the work that they do here",

            "The tour is definitely on the expensive side and doesnt scale well cost wise, as the number of passengers increase. With that said, its well organised, the staff is friendly and professional. Bessica accompanied us and did a good job clicking our pictures and guiding us throughout the day. If youre looking for an all inclusive tour where you dont have to worry about anything and budget isnt an issue, then this is it.",

            "***************MUST SUPPORT****************** Smokey (our name for this dog) is our beloved street dog that my sister conjunction with the foundation arranged to have her eye operated on at her own expense. Our family have been supporters of the Soi Dogs for many years. On our recent trip to Phuket we visited the foundation. While I knew emotionally I could not do the tour before we arrived, I insisted on purchasing some merchandise and making a donation. The foundation provides shelter and care to hundreds of homeless and abandoned Cats & Dogs These dedicated staff and volunteers are the voices for these animals and they are definitely changing there lives. Silva is a fantastic ambassador to the organization and we spent a great deal of time discussing the plight of these beautiful animals to us. Take some time away from your resort and help save these vulnerable animals and give them a life they are entitled too (without fear) Amazing Place",
            "If you love dogs, and want an immersive hands on experience then sign up as a dog Walker for Soi Dog Foundation. This organisation has been running for over 20 years, and has the best vet hospital in Asia. They rescue street dogs and cats, some of whom have been very cruelly treated. They also spey/neuter Street dogs and cats to try and reduce the numbers. You don't need any particular skills, just an empathy for animals, and a willingness to give some of your time. Some volunteers come for a couple of days, others stay for weeks at a time. The staff are beautiful, and their love for these animals is second to none. Volunteers work from Monday to Friday. On the weekends there is the Big Buddha, Phuket Elephant Sanctuary, Bangla Rd markets and heaps of other things to do and see. Do something different next holidays, do something worthwhile. Instead of being a tourist, be a volunteer. You won't regret it.",
            "This was so worth a visit. The foundation does so much for dogs and cats. They are treated so well and cared for by volunteers and paid staff. I would absolutely recommend anyone that cares for the well being of animals to see how well this is run. There are so many special dogs in there with stories.",
            "Wonderful cat and dog rescue service and hospital. The free tour was great. The facilities here are fantastic and the staff are very friendly. There is a shop here where you can buy soi dog merch. You can also spend time with the cats and pat some dogs in the puppy run.",

            "Soi Dog is an amazing place! We loved our visit here. It was a little challenging to get here - but well worth the trip! I wish all shelters could be filled with this kind of caring and love. Do your soul a favor and go!",
            "I brought a group of international school students, aged 12-17, here for a three-day visit, and we were made to feel very welcome and valued. We divided into two groups and were assigned different tasks after an introduction and briefing. We started by getting to know the dogs in their environments before beginning our walks. On Days 1 and 2, my group was given medium-sized dogs, and on Day 3, we worked with senior dogs. The students also had the opportunity to visit the cattery every lunchtime and spend some time there in the afternoons. The staff were friendly, supportive, and provided plenty of advice and tips. The lunches were excellent, with the smoothies being a fan favorite. I highly recommend this place for a few days of volunteering (or more).",
            "I brought a group of 18 international school students, aged 12-17, here for 3 days. We were made to feel very welcome and valued. We divided into two groups and were assigned to different runs, following an introduction and briefing. After getting to know the dogs in their environments, we began walking. As some of our students were young, they needed adult supervision on the walks, so we were only able to walk two dogs at a time. The grounds are beautiful and it was lovely to give the dogs some time outside of their runs. Staff were friendly, supportive and gave lots of advice and tips. The lunches are absolutely delicious and there are loads of veggie options. I highly recommend this as a great place for a few days volunteering (or more). If you are taking younger students, I would recommend bringing more staff to allow them more time to walk. Thanks to Chrissie for organising this for us!",
            "We had a wonderful time hearing about the Soi Dog Foundation from our guide, Silvia! We were just in Phuket for a day and werent sure what to do near the airport, but Im so glad that we stumbled upon soi dog. It was encouraging after seeing so many stray animals on our trip to hear about the efforts this organization takes not only to treat and rehabilitate injured and ill animals, but also the education they offer the community about animal care! Not to mention it was so fun to help socialize the puppies! We will definitely stay connected to Soi Dog Foundation from now on.",
            "This a beautiful place to visit and support. It re inspires faith in humanity. It makes me so happy to hear of what this organisation has achieved and continues to achieve to make the world a better place for the dogs and cats of Thailand and other countries. An absolute must to visit in Phuket. I would definitely recommend the amazing tour."

            "PPKK is a husband/ wife tour company. I'm glad that I booked a taxi transfer for 800 thb. Phuket is humid and the street is windy, narrow and crowded. Thus it took 1.5 hours to get from airport to my hotel in Patong. Forget about the bus simce it can take 3 hours!! Share minivan does not save much for more than 2 persons. They directly provide airport transfer and private Phuket City Tour. The price is low considering a private tour from 9 to 5pm. He helped to take pictures of us and took time to explain everything about Phuket. Moreover a private tour is needed for riding a AC car in a heavy traffic. I bought The James Bond island with big boat tour though PPKK . Big boat can take 60 persons and lunch is served on board. It also carries a lot of kayaks that are used to paddle you thru bay cave and monkey cave. The main advantage of big boat is a comfy and quiet ride that you can take a nap. Many people opt for speed boat which is noisy and bumpy but fast. I also bought the Phi Phi island tour with Catamalan big boat. Sea Angel provided tour and charged me 400 thb for park fee. Afterward I told PPKK tour and Mrs Pojjana got reimbursement for me. Kudo to PPKK service. It took 2 hrs to go from Phuket to Phi Phi island and this boat can carry 300 passengers like a ferry. When we get there at 11:30am we were transferred to a speed boat for snorkeling 20 minutes. We got back to island for 1 hour lunch and at 2:30pm the same boat returned to Phuket. Despite a comfy ride I felt that it is not worth the money because not enough time to enjoy Phi phi and neighboring islands. If you can live with a bumpy but fast speed boat you will see many islands for the same price. The Phantasea show is a surprise. While the show itself is just mediocre the construction of the theme park is spectacular. The theater is like an ancient ruins of a temple and the dining area is a fancy temple decorated with gold like ornament.",
            "We had an amazing time with PPKK Tour company! They were on schedule, informative, and extremely friendly. Definitely the best tour weve done in Phuket!!! Thank you so much Panya and PPKK!",
            "Excellent services. Everything we did thru PPKK Tour Service was great. People are nice and fair. Recommend to everyone",
            "Was recommended Panya and his wife Pojjanna by a friend who has been using their services for 10+ years. I work in customer service so I have high expectations. The customer service offered was way beyond what I imagined. From the beginning they were amazing, and this did not taper off at all for 8 days. A simple call and they would arrange tours, pickups, and even another driver if they were already on a job. Their pricing was very reasonable, and the island tours they booked us for, we found excellent. Their recommendations were spot on. I have no issues whatsoever recommending them to family and friends and anyone thinking of heading to Phuket, they are the company you want to book. For me, personal attention when providing customer service is paramount. Just by remembering my name, you have won me over. You will not regret booking them.",
            "We just returned from a 6-day trip to Phuket for our family of 5. PPKK made all our transfers and activity and transport arrangements. Poj gave us some suggestions of activities that we wanted to do, then did all the bookings and transport arrangements. This really saved us a lot of time to do research and bookings for each activity. We did John Gray Sea Canoe Hong by Starlight, ATV & Zipline, Fishing Trip, Aquaria, tour of Old Town Phuket and Naka night market. They are very responsive, we will receive a whatsapp on the next day's programme. We are repeat customers so happy to reconnect and meet Panya again, our kids remember him as Uncle Panya. Highly recommend their services! Thank you Panya and Poj!",
            "I was looking for a local tour operator for my 5 days trip to Phuket with my senior citizen parents. I looked up the reviews on the internet and shortlisted a couple including ppkk and contacted both through whatsapp. ppkk was the only operator who responded in a timely manner and quoted prices which seemed moderate and competitive. So I chose ppkk and went ahead with it. On reaching Phuket I got to know the owners of ppkk, Mr. Panya and Mrs Fortuna the couple that runs the company. These are extremely respectful and humble individuals who run their business in an efficient and transparent manner. Their rates are very decent and competitive and the cars they provide are spacious and in very good condition. I selected airport pickup and drop and 4 day trips through them. Phuket day tour, phi phi island tour, james bond island tour and Krabi islands tour and enjoyed all of them. I did face some personal challenges with my elderly parents in getting up and down the boats but that is something which is on me and my lack of research. As for ppkk, I highly recommend them for people visiting Phuket and I can vouch for their honestly and transparency.",

            "A very prompt, professional and reliable service provider. Will definitely keep using their services even in future.",
            "PPKK Tour Services was the best tour services ever in Phuket, Thailand. From Airport transfer to our hotel , A day Tour around Phuket with Panya, 1 day island hopping lunch buffet included, an afternoon program with Green Elephant Sanctuary Park and our adventure night to Phuket FantaSea Show and our airport drop-off.

            "Shocking experience! We were in the shopping centre trying to purchase four pairs of Keen sandal that cost 4500batts each , between five of us we have to try to find the size that fits us, when we were almost complete our fitting one of us have decided to try swap to a size up as the one that have selected was a bit too small, we were told by the shop assistant that served us we cant try any more as we have spent almost an hour trying the sandals, she was so rude and inpatient towards us. In the end we have decided to give up our purchase and go somewhere else thats willing to provide a better customer service. In fact, the whole time we were there the two shop assistants (male and female) attitude was very poor. The lady that served us did not showed any interest and have been concentrating in playing with her mobile phone. We have been to Phuket many times, and every time we shop at this shopping centre to buy our sovereigns home, since Covid this is the first time we been back. The whole time we were there the shopping were so quiet with very little shoppers, most of the shop assistants including the two we were dealt with were hanging around doing nothing. They could have sold four pairs and even five pairs as the fifth person was deciding of Keen sandals to us if we werent treated that badly with no respect. As a matter of fact, the whole time we were there theres no other customers around trying any shoes at the same time, its not like we were in the way when the shop assistants were too busy serving someone else. Besides, we believe its reasonable to spend a bit more time in fitting to find the most comfortable shoes that fit as its not a 200batt shoe were buying. Coming from a customers point of view we believe a huge improvement is required for some of the staff that we have came across in the shopping centre. In a service perspective staff provide great customer service made a big difference to the success of the business. We found the shopping centre presents well, its a shame that staff werent trained properly as their behaviour and attitude towards customers certainly drove people away and creates bad reputation towards the business.",
            "Lot of upscale stores, just as expensive or more expensive than in our home country. The food courts are really nice, that's the only plus. Wouldn't recommend it, also went to Jungceylon, much nicer and better for middle-class.",

            "For an island to have such a huge upscale mall, and so many stores, brands etc was impressive. I wasnt expecting too much, but they had a lot of stores. I picked a nespresso machine too at a very good rate. Very good mall and lovely decorations as well for Christmas.",
            "Good service and prices. Was 600bath in taxi from Kata Beach.This is one of the better shopping malls in Phuket. Ill comeback soon",
            "There are actually 2 malls connected by a bridge. The high end and suburban mall. For the high end, you get all the brand names, for the suburban mall you get all the daily brands, many eateries and big supermarket.",
            "I had a spare few hours to myself and bought a few things. Large variety of shops. Supermarket, designer, sports, health etc.",
            "An average experience for the average consumer. If you're looking for typical, run-of-the-mill clothing and don't mind splurging on overpriced luxury items, then this place will suit your needs. The mall boasts a variety of stores catering to the basic and less adventurous shopper, but unfortunately, it lacks that special something to make it stand out in a crowd of similar shopping centers. While there are occasional sparks of creativity in the mall's visual design and a commendable effort to embrace modernity, the touchscreen maps seem more like a hindrance than a help. Navigating the two buildings requires a fair amount of walking, and the somewhat unintuitive maps can leave you feeling a bit lost. On the bright side, there are convenient pickup locations for ride-sharing apps and taxis, making transportation a breeze. However, the outdated bathrooms are a disappointment, and the prevalence of knockoff goods vendors and poorly managed stores is hard to ignore. The absence of gaming shops, modern hobby stores, and a dedicated electronics store adds to the overall sense of mediocrity. This mall has its merits, undoubtedly, but they come at a (high) cost. It's a decent place to shop if you have no other options nearby, but the lack of uniqueness, coupled with a less-than-stellar ratio of quality offerings, leaves much to be desired. If convenience is your main concern and you're willing to overlook some drawbacks, then this mall might just do the job for you. Or if you just don't care and only want to consume, here is the perfect place my consuming friend. Be a consumer to your heart's desire.",
            "Lots of international brands here. Food mall food options are sufficient. Also a huge supermarket with great variety. Sweetest mango I have tried across Phuket in the small shops. I just think that there should be more restaurant options serving Thai food. Would have been a better experience if so but of course you can go to old town after shopping."

            "Out of all the beaches in Phuket we visited Kamala was the nicest. It genuinely felt like a tropical beach and wasn't cluttered with filthy umbrellas and loungers as Kata beach was. Beautiful sunsets and some nice restaurants and bars along the stretch. The only real downside was the rubbish washing up on the beach which rarely got cleaned up",
            "All beaches are dirty, its so sad. Horse riding not advised they are tired and not well cared for. Taxis should be 300-400Bhat but they will try for more. Best value massage is Sugar Wax!! There is a clothes shop with laundry just up the road from that and its great for clothes (and they do great job on laundry which is cheap). Stick to the Thai food, its good and has veggie options but the western food is poorly prepared and made me sick. Patong is the place to party but Kamala is nice and peaceful. Smoking is still allowed unless there are signs.",
            "We lounged on golden sands, splashed in crystal-clear waters, and enjoyed epic sunsets. The beachside food stalls served up tasty treats, and we danced to live music at the bars. It was a day full of fun, sun, and unforgettable moments!",
            "Kamala is a gem! The beach is pristine, with soft sands and clear waters. It's less crowded than other spots, offering a peaceful retreat. There are plenty of cozy cafes and restaurants serving delicious local cuisine. The sunsets are absolutely breathtaking. Highly recommended for a relaxing and beautiful getaway!",
            "We had a fantastic and unforgettable experience on a private James Bond Island speedboat tour with Tony! Our group of 11 felt like royalty with this amazing team. Everything exceeded our expectations. The stunning Phang Nga Bay scenery left us in awe, and we even saw sea eagles and monkeys on one island. Panyee Island was magical, and the superb lunch there was a highlight. This tour is the best choice to explore Thailand!",
            "Kamala Beach is on the Thai island of Phuket. It is about 13 kilometres north of Patpong. It is a lot quieter than Patpong but still has many restaurants and resorts. It is a more family oriented and for people seeking the Thai resort life without the hussle and bussle of a major Thai tourist town. The beach is clean and generally I found the Thai people working on it very easy going and no pressure sales. There are sports bars for your sporting fix, that show EPL, AFL, NRL, etc. overall a very reasonable place to stay and or visit. Highly recommend.",
            "The pristine beach provided a serene escape, while nearby attractions like the vibrant local market and cultural sites offered plenty of excitement.",
            "Lovely beach prefect for kids & family . What I loved most of this beach is its cleanliness & less crowd. Its a very good beach for a relaxing evening with calm tides .",
            "Kamala Beach is a serene paradise, ideal for those seeking tranquility. With soft sands and gentle waves, it's perfect for families and couples alike. Enjoy a peaceful escape amidst stunning natural beauty.",
            "Too many tourists. Too many activity offers, ranging from horse riding and water jets to speed boat tours and souvenirs. The restaurants offer pizza and spring rolls, the market is a fake and the river running down to the beach stinks from fish garbage. We didnt like it at all."

            "Everyone was really friendly including the elephants. We had so much fun and dirty. I highly recommend this attraction.",
            "This was an AMAZING experience! A must do. Thanks to a wonderful staff Jimmy, Arm, Tom Cruise, Gifd. Amazing My baby elephant I will miss you for ever!!! Love you and see you in another time",
            "The best experience ever. I went there with my 7 years daughter, we learned a lot from the staff, and we cooked for elephants and fed them, took bath with them, so much fun. I can feel the staff are really love and care their elephants.",
            "A taxi picked us up from the hotel. We were given information about the elephants. After that, we prepared food for the elephants and fed them. Then, we got to relax the elephants with a mud massage, followed by swimming with them. Afterward, we showered with the elephants, then we prepared Thai food ourselves and got to eat it. Finally, we painted our own elephant magnets and taxi took us back to the hotel.",
            "One of the best experiences. The people, elephants and very organised. We are glad we came here. We came with our family and friends. We can feed, bath elephants. They made us do cooking and cut some fruits which was such a fun activity.",
            "I highly recommend this sanctuary. Worth the money, most proceeds going towards the welfare of the animals. Buy the highest priced ticket and buy souvenirs, all for good cause! We prepped the food for the elephants, fed them, had a close and personal interactions; bathe them - which involves, rubbing them with mud, washing them off, scrubbing gentle with a brush and showering them again. You will get tired, you will get muddy, you can have shower afterwards, cook your own food under gentle guidance from helpful and cheerful guides, you will be fed to the brink and you will leave with a big smile on your face and unforgettable memories!",
            "This place was both educational and fun!! The guides were friendly and we had an amazing time. We got way more thank we expected. And the level of care was second to none!! A must experience",
            "Really good place to spend time and money on. Everything they do is for the care of the elephants. Extremely fun and definitely worth it",
            "I went on a solo trip to the half day tour. An experience ill never forget. My family is annoyed because they missed out. I've been to Thailand 3 times and never interacted or done anything with elephants purely because I couldn't find an ethical one. After research, I thought I'd try this one. Absolutely amazing and would come again. The half day experience was fantastic finished off with a lovely lunch catered to all preferences. Not only that, there were many little things considered that some tours forget (and tourists) for example, a plastic bag for our wet clothes if we wanted etc. A trip worth doing!!",
            "Amazing visit. Loved feeding and loving the elephants. Even in the rain, it was a wonderful experience. Would visit again"

We put the welfare of our elephants first and do not offer bathing, rides, shows, mud bathing, trunk hugging, elephant kisses, sitting on or lying on the elephants, loud noisy groups, or people constantly crowding around the elephants. If you think of an elephant living life in the forest surrounded by the sounds of nature then this is what we offer. Our tours offer Education, Interaction, and Observation. Visitors enjoy an up-close encounter with our beautiful elephants during the feeding program, then we walk with the elephants, stand back and observe as they roam, bathe, play, and socialise naturally, free from human touch. We give our elephants back their lives and their dignity, and in doing so, our guests get to learn about how incredible the largest land mammal on earth truly is. We look forward to welcoming you.

            "Before booking this few-hour solo tour, I, like many others (and as everyone should do), researched the best ethical and humane options for visiting elephants. This sanctuary is extremely well-run and informative. They employ many well-trained local people, and everything is set up very professionally. They have rescued elephants from camps, captivity, or other places where these amazing animals were misused or abused. These elephants roam freely here, and you feel like you are helping the animals by paying a fee to watch them in their natural habitat. It's very well done, and the staff are committed to protecting the elephants from exploitation.",
            "Great day, friendly and informative tour guides, lovely lunch. Would recommend for families. Very cheap shop too, profits going to the elephants",
            "Highly, highly, highly recommend Phuket Elephant Sanctuary!!!!! They are extremely ethical and their care and love towards each of their elephants is so evident and beautiful. It was incredible to see these beautiful animals in a respectful way. Special thank you for Tour, our guide, for providing us a fabulous tour! So happy to support this cause!!",
            "We did a lot of research before booking this trip. So chose this elephant nature reserve, Accredited, Sustainable, Award-winning, and Ethical Elephant Sanctuary in Phuket. xxxx Booked direct with the sanctuary. Beware dont book with a trip that allows bathing with elephants this is not ethical! And its forced! Your provided with boots and socks, split up into small groups. Snacks, cold drinks and a short video, which highlights the much needed work this sanctuary does. We walked around and met the elephants for short periods and it wasnt too invasive for the animals. Our tour TO-URguide was lovely. Answered all our questions. Very humbling experience. Worth every penny.",
            "We visited today and had the most wonderful experience seeing and learning about elephants. Staff are so knowledgeable about the rescued elephants that they care for and shared this with the visitors. We were a mixed family group of six aged 2 to 62 but this visit suited us all. Our guide. Yaya, made sure that we were all comfortable and happy throughout while helping to maintain a safe and calm environment for the elephants. Its extremely well organised from transfers to clean socks, wellies and raincoats. They provide excellent clean up facilities and a really nice lunch with drinks. Staff were welcoming from start to finish and we all felt privileged to have been able to experience the tour today. Dont miss this tour , its the best thing to do in Phuket.",
            "We were looking for an ethical elephant experience and we found one! The elephants are free-range on 30 acres of land, each one has its own caretaker that follows it around 24/7 to make sure it is happy, healthy, and fed, and the guides make sure to inform the tourists about elephant safety and welfare and enforce the sanctuarys rules so that the humans and elephants are safe and happy. At the end of the tour we got to feed the elephants fruit! Tour was followed up with a delicious early dinner. Would highly recommend. The tour includes rain boots, water bottle, and umbrella.",
            "Amazing experience to see the elephants in a non exploitive environment, amazing facilities and tour guide was incredible !!!",
            "The canopy walk was perfect for us. We got a good view of the elephants and being high in the air, there werent a lot of mosquitos. Feeding the elephants at the end was just enough time to be close to the elephants.",
            "Amazing experience, we enjoyed the encounter with the elephants. This place is a real sanctuary and they show a real love for the animals."

We had plenty of space to relax on the boat and drinks and snacks were available onboard. Alex is our personal guide for canoeing. It was a great experience as the caves were really dark, and when we were out in the open. we were greeted with the most beautiful Hong and mangrove. At James Bond Island, we went onshore to take some beautiful photos without the crowds and Alex helped to take some really nice pictures. We had a delicious dinner cooked by the chef on board, I like especially the chicken curry in coconut milk and the tom yum soup. We watched the lovely sunset over Phang Nga bay. We were blessed with good weather today. Thanks, Capt. Mark, Jack, Alex and team, we had the best times in Phuket. We really look forward to another great tour with PST.",
            "Had a great time from pick up to drop off. 8 of us in our group and all different ages. All up maybe 14-16 people on our tour. The crew were amazing and tentative to all our needs. Food was excellent and plenty of it. Lots of laughs and weather was great. Would highly recommend Captain Mark and his crew, safety is A+",
            "We, a family of 4 from India,had an absolutely amazing trip on the sunset tour. Me and my husband had gone on a VIP James bond island tour in 2017 and had loved it, so wanted to do it with our kids now . I was looking for a luxury catamaran, but my husband was not interested in going with a big tour of 80+ pax. As we were exploring, found this on TripAdvisor, rated quite highly. Captain Mark caught our eye and I put an enquiry on their website. Prompt and clear communication was the deciding factor. Website, pricing, ease of communication and payment was a big positive. Very professional service , pick up, welcome by Jack, our host,and what to expect on the trip, set the mood. The sea canoeing, walk through mangrove caves, sunset on the boat was amazing. But what was simply amazing, was the night canoe ride in the caves,in pitch darkness,with sighting of plankton. The ride back in absolute quiet and darkness, with just a brilliant starlit sky and soft melodies playing ..an amazing experience. The paddlemen,ours was Mai mai, Choky,Alex, the chef all were lovely. The big boat was well maintained with 2 washrooms,lot of space. We had many travelers from Australia , had some nice conversations. A definitely recommended trip.",
            "Best excursion we have ever been on! Cannot fault anything the team and trip were brilliant from the moment we got picked up from the hotel. We absolutely loved it and so did my 4 year old who was so spoilt by the team. Thank you for everything, honestly it was by far the best boat trip we have ever been on.",
            "Amazing tour, guides were fantastic, so much information and so friendly. We didnt feel rushed anywhere and the boat was not overcrowded like you see so much with other companies.",
            "When we think of Thailand, we dream about the beautiful little islands in the warm Andaman Sea. The memory will stay in our hearts forever. From our initial contact booking with Phuket Sail Tours, we received an immediate confirmation and from then on, every step of our tour was clockwork and more than we expected. Our ticket included a private driver who picked up us on time from our hotel. When arrived at the office for check in, we were greeted with a light snack while the other guests checked in. After a few minutes, Captain Jack went over the itinerary for the trip. We then shuttled to the boat which was spacious, clean and updated. No untended paint or uncomfortable cushions. Mark, co-Captain and owner of the boat and the crew greeted us and immediate set out a hot lunch and free non alcoholic beverages. This wasnt the typical booze cruise, although there was beer for anyone who wanted it. Though out the day, Captain Jack would come around offering soda, ice cold expresso or water. We made our first stop and proceed thru the day through 5 more stops and the tour culminated seeing the James Bond island. Afterwards the cooking staff served a lovely homemade Thai dinner including whole baked seasoned fish, rice, tempura and steamed vegetables, Tom Kah Gai soup and chicken with potatoes in coconut milk. We visited the bat caves after dinner when the sun went down and saw the bio luminous plankton in the caves. The crew was super attentive and helped my husband and I with getting in and out of the canoes (we are in our mid 60s), took pictures for us and listened as we had specific questions and needs. Not many tour companies take such care w their customers but we felt especially well cared for and served at the highest level. The trip was worth every penny we spent, we appreciated the personal service and every detail of the day! Its been a dream for us to see the little islands in Phuket and we will always remember this day.",
            "What an amazing day! My family & I had a great time at Phi Phi Island. The team were very knowledgeable and friendly specially with our young ones.",
            "We did the James Bond Sunset tour on my birthday. Everything was perfect about this excursion from the first point of contact, to the pick up within a window of 10 minutes, the well timed fried chicken, fruit and chips not long after boarding. The excellent paddling and care from the boat men. The personable and lovely Captain Jack. The absolutely delicious dinner made by the wonderful chef. Everything was very personalised and there were only 10 guests on the boat. The scenery was absolutely stunning and breathtaking. Perfect day/ night.",
            "Wonderful afternoon and evening boat trip which was so enjoyable. Thanks to Jack and the excellent team a brilliant day was had. I would thoroughly recommend this company. Excellent service, great value for money and everyone extremely friendly. A small number of fellow passengers (less than 15) which made the experience great, lovely food served on board and some amazing views along the way. Great to visit the famous James Bond Island and to visit several other beauty spots and even travel in a kayak through some amazing caves!! Chilled drinks served throughout the tour and lots of fascinating information shared throughout the day. Hotel to boat departure and return point arranged through the company as well. A brilliant day with some brilliant experiences!!! I would thoroughly recommend. Thank you.",
            "The views were amazing loved that there was only a maximum of 18 people on board. Captain Jack kept us informed throughout the entire trip. Especially enjoyed the canoeing through the caves. Would highly recommend this boat tour it ticks all the boxes with plenty to see."

            "We wanted to experience Phukets iconic symbol, the Big Buddha. We hired a private driver who took us here. No shorts or sleeveless tops are allowed so our driver took us shopping beforehand. There was no admission fee and toilet facilities were very clean. Its located on top of the mountain where a taxi is allowed to drive up (but one can jog / hike up the hill). There are a few restaurants along the way, as well as the Tiger Park and elephants nearby.",

            "A must see in Phuket. This was the finale of the trip for us and it was the most apt closure that you can expect. I went in with the question as to what is the big deal about this show and I came out with utmost respect for the founders and the lady boys who did a dazzling display of dance. The hour went by like anything. The dance and costume were just mind blowing. It was by far the best show that I have been to. It can be seen with family. There are couple of songs with adult theme but nothing vulgar. DO NOT MISS.",
            "The show was good but DO NOT TAKE OUT YOUR PHONE TO TAKE A PICTURE OF OR WITH THE DANCERS AFTER THE SHOW. Keep your phone tucked away as if you dont have it on you. They will pressure you hard to take a photo with them then demand 200 baht EACH for the photo. Completely ruined the experience and will tell everyone I know to stay away from this show.",
            "Great show , fantastic costumes and lighting like a vegas style cabaret. Great theatre well organised comfy seats nice bar area great organised transport included in the ticket cost of you want it . The dancers line up at the end for photographs and was lovely to see them close up , we have read about this how they charge you for this , most people must now be aware of this and our ticket seller also told us when we got the tickets . People stayed well back from them and took pictures and videos . The performers struggled to get people over so I think this problem is over . Great night out whilst in Phucket x",
            "Phukets one of the biggest bar in the bangala road. It's all time happening in the afternoon. People go there n enjoy from afternoon to the whole night.",
            "Good show with spectacular costumes. It covers songs and dance of different nations including India, Japan, Korea, Chinese etc.",
            "A world class show , spectacular. Colours, lights, songs, dances and a harmony of joy. We loved the show over all. You can take pictures by the performers after the show as well.",
            "Overall a good experience. The show is a bit sexual to bring kids to. The lip syncing could get better almost cringable. One of the performers could sing, would be nice to have a non lip sync number. The dancing/performance was mediocre however the costumes were beautiful. Would be fun if the dancing was more advanced. It was a fun experience but not something I would do again",
            "I quite enjoyed the performance but the photo scam at the end of the show is shameful behaviour by the performers. If theyre not getting paid enough they need to take this up with their employers. Not the audience who have already put their hands in their pockets. For this reason I will not be recommending this show to friends and family who travel to Thailand."

They honestly spend time to discuss style and guide you with various options to customise your garments. The level of detail in the craftsmanship really speaks volume. The team at RK Fashions produced beautiful wool jackets for me, which is perfect especially being based in the UK. There is a wide selection of fabrics including the finer details i.e lining and buttons. The fit is wonderful and I am truly delighted with my order. I will not hesitate to use RK Fashions again and I highly recommend there services. Definitely among the best tailoring experiences!",
            "RK Fashions and Tailors are a hidden gem in Patong. The whole staff was very professional, friendly and courteous. I had a substantial order and was quite specific in what I wanted. They were able to work with me and produced exactly what I had envisioned. I had three fittings and was pleasantly surprised at the speed as well as the attention to detail of their craftmanship. Whilst I did place a large order, I will be contacting them for more items. Raj and Reena were wonderful hosts. They and their team were a joy to deal with and I highly recommend them to anyone thinking of having clothing made.",

Well don't waste your time with these shops, and go directly to RK Fashions and Taylor, you will get the best advices from professionals who take their time to provide you the best service. I've been throught 5 fittings, they take the necessary time for you to be happy with the end product. I will definitely order again from them.",

The final product is of very high quality, both fabric and workmandship. I've used many different tailors in the past, they are far the best. Highly recommended to all and a must if visiting Patong!",

I would highly recommend RK Fashions to anyone looking for custom fitted high quality clothing. Thanks again to Raj & Reena!",

The two are very nice and accommodating. After my decision Raj measured me. The suit with shirt arrived last week and I must say I am thrilled. Everything fits perfectly, just as I imagined. The fabric has a super quality. In November they are back in Germany. This was certainly not my last suit I bought. Keep up the good work! I can recommend anyone who wants a custom suit for a good price.",
            "Great service and quality! I first visited RK Fashions in 2019 when I was looking to get a tailored suit made. Raj and Reena are very friendly yet professional in advising the right material, style and fit. I have had several suits made from them, one of them as recently in Sep 2022. I would highly recommend RK Fashions to anyone looking for good quality tailored suits or other outfits that are reasonably priced.",

The couple took their time and effort to not only get to know me but also ensure that the right solution is chosen. It's always a pleasure to deal with people who care about their work and customers so I recommend them very very highly.",

It is an art to maintain the highest level of quality over such a long period. Suits and Shirts that I have used for more than 5 years are still look and feel like new.A worthwhile invest with a very good return",

It was a great decision, because, unlike the usual fun dives, the course allows you to learn the necessary theoretical base, as well as smoothly build up your practical diving skills. In addition, the obtained certificate will help you with diving in other places all around the world. I would also like to thank my instructor Jonathan Parr. He explained both the theory and the practical part of the exercises in a very accessible way. John was very friendly and approachable. He broke up our sessions so that I could learn new information and skills at a comfortable pace. I gained a lot of useful knowledge from him and overall, I couldn't have wished for a better teacher. Also, John is excellent underwater photographer, the photos from our last diving turned out to be really great!",

The location of Phuket Five Tours at Kata Beach was best. They have own dive training pool there, and the place is located within walking distance to Kata Beach which was useful for the day-2 beach dives. Our instructor, Mr. Somkid, was so understanding and paced his training based on our abilities. We went slow but steady - and got certified within the 3 days of learning.",
            "Great dives to King Cruiser, Shark point and Koh DoKMai. Special thanks to Sky took care of us with great professionalism and fun.",
            "What a great day! We had the opportunity to dive with our experienced and charismatic dive master Sky. My husband and I are two Padi instructors who love to enjoy nice and relaxing dives with no stress and Sky was able to gave this to us, making as always diving an enjoyable experience. We began the dives with a refreshing jump into the water. Sky was all the time looking after us, guiding us through coral gardens, the sunken shipwreck and curious sea creatures. Although visibility wasnt great, the vibrant coral reefs were breathtaking. Colorful fan corals, lots of fishes and anemones swaying in the gentle flow. Sky was showing us hidden Ghost Pipefish, Sharks and tiny nudibrabches. Lovely day to remember, looking forward to do it again",
            "The diving was wonderful, an excellent transfer to the ship, a comfortable boat (big, a lot of space, here are three decks), and wonderful service (the scuba was assembled at the beginning of the dive, and it was also assembled every time after filling the balloon). And of course, beautiful reefs, beautiful inhabitants of the depths of the sea. I will separately note the instructor, Alla Vlasenko, she literally gave a lot of useful advice for 1-2 dives, perfectly weighed me, special thanks to her!",
            "Just finished the 3 days open water course with Jon Parr from Phuket Dive Tours, he's an awesome instructor one can ever ask for, very professional, organized, patience, and take really good care of the divers. This was my first time learning to dive and was kind of nervous and panicky, but Jon was there every step of the way and made it a smooth sailing, thanks so much for this unforgettable memory Jon! You are the best!!! Hannah",
            "My husband already has his diving license and I've been meaning to do mine for a while so we finally decided to do it now during our trip to Phuket. My instructor Jon (coolest British dude that you will meet in your life) was the most helpful, kind and patient teacher that I could have hoped for. It was a wonderful experience and he took away a lot of the anxiety that I had about doing my diving certification in a different country. Would definitely recommend Phuket Dive Tours and we will be booking future diving excursions through them again!",
            "4th time in 2 years we have come back to Phuket to do courses and fun dives with Phuket Dive Tours. Fabulous everytime no matter what we did. Superb instructors and a great team. Highly recommended! Took me from a very nervous non diver to completion of my advanced adventurer. They go at your pace and safety and comfort is paramount. No 1 for diving in Phuket. A+++++++ Special thanks to Jon Parr, Tim Mayor, Dave and Benz. See you soon. Sara (Australia)",

            "The Diving course with Ramin was amazing! We had such a good time and felt always save with him. We really liked that you dont have to think about anything. Getting pickt up every morning and getting a bunch of meals on the boat makes it very easy to plan your day. We will definitely come back for a few fun dives! Thank you Ramin for making our trip as amazing as it was!!",
            "If you look into all the things that can go wrong while diving, it starts sounding scary, but luckily, we were paired with Beam for our first dives. He kept learning fun but safe, and we appreciated his warm but professional attitude. The dive boat was a new experience for us, and both Beam and Sam helped us navigate through it successfully. Super Divers brings great value for the price, and we're glad we went with them for our open water PADI cert!",
            "This was our first diving experience and it was fantastic. Johan, our instructor, immediately made us feel at ease and was very clear in giving information about the dives and the day ahead. Myself and my wife had a great day and I would highly recommend Super Divers.",
            "I did my Advanced Open Water course in May 2024. Very profession instructor and well organized company. Nice dive sites in Phuket as well! Small groups with the instructor!",
            "I participated in the PADI Open Water Certification Course with Super Divers, from 14th to 16th April, 2024. Right from Day 1, up till Day 3, everything was very nicely organized and planned to the T. It was very impressive. I would like to specifically call out my instructor, Mr. Beam, who has been very patient with me in the last three days. Thanks to him I had such an enriching experience, and am taking ahead such wonderful memories of Scuba Diving. Mr. Beam was always forthcoming and supportive and answered all my questions each time with patience. He is extremely knowledgeable about both theoretical and technical aspects of scuba diving. I thoroughly enjoyed all my dives with him, and I am grateful that I had the opportunity to learn so much from him. I look forward to applying the knowledge I have gained to my future dives! Ill definitely be coming back to Super Divers for my Advanced Scuba Diving Course!!",
            "We first contacted Super Divers in August 2023 enquiring about booking our son, 15, onto some dives during our time in Thailand. They have been amazing with help and advice all the way up to our holiday and this continued throughout our holiday. Our son, whilst an accomplished PADI diver, has autism and feeling comfortable is massively important to him and us. The team and Sam, instructor, were amazing. On the second day of diving, completing his Wreck speciality, our son was struggling with equalizing his ears and Sams patience and advice was First Class. We would highly recommend the team at Super Divers to anyone looking for a friendly, informative and highly competent dive school.",
            "Amazing dive trip. They were really kind and helpful from the very beginning to the end. Such a great experience, perfect organization, safety and they even shared the pictures with us.",
            "Thank you Super Divers especially my training instructors Johan and Sam for an amazing experience. This experience has fuelled my love for the sea and I will continue with my diving journey in South Africa. The entire experience of booking, communicating with the organisers at Super Divers, payment, transportation by road and sea, food, scuba gear, etc, everything was very professional and no hassles. The boat crew including the boat boys and chefs of the Freedom Dolphins were also amazing. Good choice Super Divers Safety was always key in everything that they did. If you have a passion to learn how to scuba dive and youre in Phuket, please give Super Divers a call, you will not be disappointed. Top tip though, please complete the online course before you start the course for maximum benefit. Diving comes with risks and the best way to deal with them is educating yourself. Happy diving",
            "I did my OWD course there with my instructor Nat! It was great, the staff of the dive school is so friendly and obliging! Nat was a great instructor, it was fun talking and listening to her - I can recommend this dive school so much ! Also, my friends decided to came with me on the dive day for some DiscoverScubaDive with a German freelancer/instructor Rob. They enjoyed their day on the boat very much and had a fun time. Thanks a lot to the team - for all people interested in diving - go to Super Divers Phuket!",
            "What an experience. From start to finish the level of service was incredible. Fast, efficient and friendly contact from Josh & Andy meant a seamless service was achieved. No question was too much trouble ( and I had a fair few ). I decided to take the plunge ( pun intended ) and go for my open water qualification with a nitrox air course added too. The booking and payment process was easy and safe and all e-learning was sent quickly which gave me the opportunity to get this done before travelling to save time when I was there. Once in resort all the contact was done over email with transfer times to the pool for the practice sessions and then to the pier for the dives all arriving on time. My only negative was that I didnt realise ( and may be my fault ) the dives went from Chalong pier. I presumed we went from Patong which is where the office was and so I stayed in Patong. Chalong is a half hour transfer and I would have rather stayed there than Patong as its a quieter area and more my style but thats more my fault. Anyway back to the service. I was paired with Ramin as my instructor for my course. I cannot speak highly enough of Ramin. What a guy! It was only myself on the course and so I received what felt like an extremely exclusive 1 to 1 service. From start to finish everything was at a pace to suit me. Time was taken to explain every step. The confined pool dives were done in great time, never rushed and explained in a way I understood. Ramins English was of a high level and so there were never any confusion. Then the dives. Thats the main part. WOW WOW WOW. Even better than I ever imagined. What a super professional set up. We did 6 dives over 2 days on 2 separate dive boats. Both boats were busy, full mostly of experienced divers. The company used to provide the dive boats have a great relationship with Super Divers and knew Ramin very well and made sure I was catered for exceptionally well as they were aware I was a learner. My equipment was placed in an area easier for me to use which was such a great thought. The boat staff looked out for me when I was getting ready too. Ramin was so professional and took me step by step all the way. I didnt once feel unsafe or unsupported both on the boat and underwater. Ramin always checked in with me. I had problems equalising my ears on occasions and Ramin kept me calm and helped me work through this. Ramin pointed out many fish and aquatic life whilst diving and during our last dives he kindly took his camera with him and for a small fee took many photos which he then transferred to my phone so I have the memories of a life time. In summary, if you are thinking of diving in Phuket or doing a course, the please use Super Divers. You will not be disappointed. For the price I paid I cannot believe the service I received. It was one of the best decisions I ever made. Thank you again, and please pass my appreciation on to Ramin. A guy Ill remember forever. Cheers, Ady"

She was great at explaining everything, teaching us the language, and exposing us to some of the most amazing authentic flavors I have ever experienced. Strongly recommend the hibiscus tea, the crapes, the curry lamb with naan, and there was an amazing salad we had with nuts, garlic, and Chiles",

Our guide Lucky was so nice, knowledgeable and helpful we were lucky to have her. It was an easy walk around the Markets with explanations of ingredients in dishes then the walk in beautiful old town. We never would have found or even tried some of the dishes or drinks we ate. If you want to experience some different dishes dont miss this. We enjoyed everything but did struggle to eat everything. Do not eat breakfast!

            "The team at Aussie Divers were absolutely amazing! From the training, organisation and dive sites, I definitely had a great time. Darren and the team were very prompt with emails and messages and made the experience very enjoyable. If you're ever in Phuket, I'd definitely recommend them!",
            "If your considering exploring the world of diving I HIGHLY recommend the professional crew at Aussie Divers Phuket. As an Australian traveling to Phuket for the first time I was a little apprehensive about learning to diving in Thailand but once I engaged with Aussie Divers I knew I was in good hands. From the first inquiry email the communication was exceptional. I always knew what was happening and where I was meant to be so much so when I finally walked into the shop on day 1 and met the crew I felt right at home and the banter started almost immediately, at least after I noticed the St Kilda AFL jumper on display and commented on how poorly they were playing (Sorry Darren). I was booked to do the Open Water 3 day 6 dive course along with four others. Martin and Rome, our dive instructors, were extremely professional and ensured everyone understood the basic training and were comfortable and confident with our gear at the pool on day 1. Day 2 saw us plunge into the open water for the first 3 dives under Martins guidance. He's professionalism during each dive brief and what to expect when underwater, what to look out for and the skills we needed to tick off while in the water filled the group full of confidence. The debrief session after each dive helped us all understand where our shortfall were and how we can improve for our next dives. I personalty learnt a lot in those first three dives. The boat was also great, very well catered for with awesome Thai food and beverages available all day. Beers even came out after the final dive for the journey home Day 3 saw us travel to the Phi Phi Islands with a stop at shark point. An awesome day diving. Martin again was exceptional in his instructions, dive brief and debrief. We had a great chat over a few beers on the 3 hour trip back to port at the end of the day he has a vast knowledge of diving and is happy to share, top bloke. Martin also shared a heap of photos he'd taken over the two open water dives of the group which was greatly appreciated. Now I'm addicted and can't wait to get back in the water. I highly recommend Aussie Divers for anyone traveling to Phuket and interested in starting or continuing their Scuba Diving Learning journey. A great team of professionals who are passionate about the sport.",
            "We booked the three dives (2 at Koh Phi Phi and 1 at Shark Point) excursion and it was nothing but amazing! Our dive master Franck answered all our questions and made sure we were comfortable before getting in the water as it was out first time doing a boat dive. The boat crew was awesome with getting our gear together. We saw so much marine life, it was beautiful! Darren and Ash were wonderful with booking and confirming details before our dive. Would 10/10 recommend Aussie Divers! We are definitely planning on diving with them again in the future when we return to Phuket.",
            "Great dive shop to do certifications and fun dives. The organization was great and the service was the best Ive ever had diving. Would recommend to anyone going to Phuket",
            "Diving with Aussie Divers Phuket was an incredible opportunity. It was a pleasure meeting the team and taking my first open water scuba diving course with them, alongside my family, with my niece and nephew getting their certification with them in Dec 2023. Even with choppy waters on the first day and limited visibility on the second, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment. The weather challenges only added to the adventure, making it even more memorable. Eamonn was an exceptional instructor - patient, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic. He was particularly great with the kids, ensuring we all felt safe and confident throughout the course. He also pointed out some amazing underwater creatures, making the experience unforgettable. Thank you again for the outstanding experience. I look forward to returning to Phuket and diving with Aussie Divers again soon.",
            "Aurng was fabulous and we really enjoyed the dive with her. She spotted plenty of big guys for us -- turtles, moray, and a leopard shark! She also managed the strong current and low visibility conditions very well, making the dives pleasant. We were very impressed by the boat, crew, and the meals provided throughout the day. It made the whole experience that much better. This was our second time using Aussie Divers and will certainly come back to them if we find ourselves in Phuket again!",
            "After the last dive, I felt incredibly lucky that we chose Aussie Divers for our first diving experience. The team, led by Darren, is exceptionally professional and welcoming. Special thanks to our coach, Zoe - you are an AWESOME coach and a SUPER LADY who kept us safe and made our journey enjoyable. Thank you Zoe and the entire Aussie Divers team. Hope to see you guys soon! Feng & JL",
            "The boat ride wasnt for me, it was unusual but i manage to just sleep it off until the dive so i feel better. Mattia explain everything so clear and good and so obviously i didnt have any question for him but im glad i had him as our guide as i didnt have enough weight and my buoyancy was mehh haha but well Mattia was there to help! he was good and ohh yeah a shout out to the owner (Darren) ! he manage to find where my location was rather then the thai driver.",
            "I took my open water course here. It was a lot of fun! Our instructor, Gong is a professional and was patient with any questions and concerns that we had. Will dive with Aussie Divers the next time were back to Phuket. We visited during the shoulder season of the beginning of May, and I was worried about water visibility. The waters were calm and clear.",
            "I dove with Aussie Divers in May and was so pleased with my experiencea 3-dive fun dive package at Phi Phi Islands. I didn't have time to stay on Phi Phi Islands, so this was a great day-trip option from Phuket. They did a great job communicating timing for my hotel pickup, and even dropped me off at the next hotel I was staying at (since I checked out that morning). We boarded a large boat that also had other dive shop groups (this makes sense given the long journey to Phi Phi). The boat operators have this down to a science. Despite the different dive operators on the boat, there was no confusion about whose gear was whose because we had specific spots for each diver. We even had two freshwater showers at the back of the boat for those coming in from dives! Because it was low season, I was lucky enough to be the only one paired with my dive master, Martin. He's a great DMhis dive briefings were very thorough, he set clear expectations on timing, and pointed out lots of marine life that I otherwise wouldn't have spotted. I felt very comfortable asking him any question between dives, ranging from our next dive to the types of marine life we spotted in the prior dive. Also, I was so pleased by the lunch buffetprops to the chef! There was never a point where I went hungry. After every dive, more food appeared. The boat staff were also very kind, and so helpful when leaving or coming back from dives. I highly recommend Aussie Divers Phuket to anyone looking for a quality day-trip to dive around Phi Phi islands!"
